5	Determining the cause of chronic cough is crucial to effective treatment. In many cases, more than one underlying condition may be causing your chronic cough. . If you are currently smoking, your doctor will discuss with you your readiness to quit and provide assistance to achieve this goal. . Antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. These drugs are standard treatment for allergies and postnasal drip. Inhaled asthma drugs. The most effective treatments for asthma-related cough are corticosteroids and bronchodilators, which reduce inflammation and open up your airways. Antibiotics. If a bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial infection is causing your chronic cough, your doctor may prescribe medications to address the infection. Acid blockers. When lifestyle changes don't take care of acid reflux, you may be treated with medications that block acid production. Some people need surgery to resolve the problem. Coughing also helps prevent infections. Cough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Medicines can help control a cough and make it easier to cough up mucus. Your doctor may recommend medicines such as: Prescription cough suppressants, also called antitussives. These medicines can help relieve a cough. Examples of fluids are water, soup, and juice. Ask your doctor how much fluid you need. Cough in Children No evidence shows that cough and cold medicines help children recover more quickly from colds. These medicines can even harm children.
24	Primary familial brain calcification is caused . The most commonly mutated gene is called SLC20A2, and accounts for an estimated 40 percent of cases, followed by the PDGFRB gene, which is mutated .. The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon: 1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging, 2) presence ) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history. For individuals in who a diagnosis of PFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. Testing that might be done includes biochemical analysis , as well as analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive , molecular genetic testing should be considered. To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known. Medications can be used to treat symptoms associated with this condition, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence.
38	Fortunately, 70% eventually experience full recovery. With careful intensive care and successful treatment of infection, autonomic dysfunction and other medical complications, even those individuals with respiratory failure usually survive. . Typically, the point of greatest weakness occurs days after the first symptoms occur. The recovery period may be as little up . Some individuals still report ongoing improvement after 2 years. About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barr have residual weakness after 3 years. About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations . About 15 percent of individuals experience long-term weakness; some may require ongoing use of a walker, wheelchair, or ankle support. Muscle strength may not return uniformly. Recovery can take weeks, months, or years. Most people survive and recover completely. In some people, mild weakness may persist. The outcome is likely to be good . Possible complications of GBS include: Breathing difficulty (respiratory failure) Shortening of tissues in the joints (contractures) or other deformities Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) that form when the person with GBS is inactive or has to stay in bed Increased risk of infections Low or unstable blood pressure Paralysis that is permanent Pneumonia Skin damage (ulcers) Breathing food or fluids into the lungs.
94	The prostate gland is located underneath the bladder and is . , you can see that part of the urethra is encased within the prostate gland. , the prostate typically enlarges in size in a process called benign hypertrophy, which means that the gland got larger without becoming cancerous. The enlarged prostate crowds its anatomical neighbors, particularly the urethra, causing it to narrow. The narrowed urethra results . Symptoms may include a slowed or delayed start in urination, the need to urinate frequently during the night, difficulty in emptying the bladder, a strong, sudden urge to urinate, and incontinence. Less than half have symptoms of the disease, or their symptoms are minor and do not restrict their life style. BPH is a normal physiological process of aging and treatment options are available. The choice is based on the severity of the symptoms, the extent to which they affect lifestyle, and the presence . Treatment options include "watchful waiting," lifestyle changes, medicines, or surgery. , you are more likely to have symptoms. But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better. If you have BPH, you should have a yearly exam to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment. BPH symptoms improve in some men . Watch out for drugs that may make your symptoms worse:SAW PALMETTO. Many herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms.
95	Ask your provider how much you can use the arm where the pacemaker was placed. You may be advised not to: Lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms) Push, pull, and twist your arm . Raise your arm . When you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your pacemaker and has contact information for emergencies. You should always carry this wallet card with you. You should try to remember the name of the pacemaker manufacturer if you can in case you lose your card Most machines and devices will not interfere with your pacemaker. But some may. Always ask your provider about any specific device that you need to avoid. DO NOT put a magnet near your pacemaker. Most appliances in your home are safe to be around. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, computers and fax machines, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwaves. You should keep several devices at least 12 inches (30 centimeters) away from the site where the pacemaker is placed under your skin. These include: Battery powered cordless tools () Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws) Electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers Slot machines Stereo speakers Tell all providers that you have a pacemaker before any tests are done. Some medical equipment may interfere with your pacemaker. Stay away . DO NOT lean over the open hood of a car that is running. Also stay away from: Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers Large electrical- or gasoline-powered appliances If you have a cell phone: DO NOT put it as your pacemaker. When using your cell phone, hold it . Be careful around metal detectors and security wands. Handheld security wands may interfere with your pacemaker. Show your wallet card and ask to be hand searched. Most security gates are OK. But DO NOT stand . Your pacemaker may set off alarms. After any operation, have your provider check your pacemaker.
97	States require newborn hearing screenings. Treating hearing loss early can allow many infants to develop normal language skills without delay. In infants born with hearing loss, treatments should start as early as age 6 months. Treatment depends on the baby's overall health and the cause of hearing loss. Treatment may include: Speech therapy Learning sign language Cochlear implant (for those with profound sensorineural hearing loss) Treating the cause of hearing loss may include: Medicines for infections Ear tubes for repeated ear infections Surgery to correct structural problems. Assistive listening devices devices can help you hear . Some hearing aids can be plugged to help you hear better. Cochlear Implant If your hearing loss is severe and , your doctor may suggest that you talk implant. An otolaryngologist is a surgeon . A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that the surgeon places . The device picks up sounds, changes them to electrical signals, and sends them . Hearing through a cochlear implant sounds different from normal hearing, but it lets many people communicate orally , and perceive sounds in the environment. Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs . This may be because: The 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly. Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include: Buildup of wax to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum Fluid remaining in the ear after an ear infection Foreign object that is stuck Scar on the eardrum from repeated infections Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed. Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by: Acoustic neuroma Age-related hearing loss Childhood infections, such as meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever, and measles Mnire' disease Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation) Use of certain medicines Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to: Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures Genetic conditions (more than 4 are known) Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, or herpes The ear can also be injured by: Pressure differences (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear) Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones. Sensorineural deafness is a type of hearing loss. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or the brain.
102	, no effective cure currently exists for people with transverse myelitis. Treatments are designed to manage and alleviate symptoms and largely depend . Physicians often prescribe corticosteroid therapy to decrease inflammation. Corticosteroid medications that might be prescribed may include methylprednisone or dexamethasone. Chronic pain is a common complication of transverse myelitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, others) can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Bed rest is often recommended . , additional therapeutic options may be added. Plasma exchange therapy is often used to severe transverse myelitis who dont show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids. This therapy involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which blood cells are suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma loss with special fluids. It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removes antibodies that are involved in inflammation. Some patients respond very well to intravenous cyclophosphamide (a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia). The outlook for people with transverse myelitis varies. About a third of people with transverse myelitis recover completely. Some people recover with moderate disabilities, such as bowel problems and trouble walking. Those who may have poor chance of recovery are: People who have rapid onset of symptoms People whose symptoms do not improve Transverse myelitis usually only occurs once in most people. It may recur in some people People may be more likely to develop MS in the future. Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord, which carries nerve signals from the brain . The segment of the spinal cord that has inflammation or damage determines the symptoms a person has. Generally, inflammation at one segment causes symptoms . Most commonly, the upper spinal cord is affected, causing impaired leg movement, and problems controlling the bowel and bladder. The onset of symptoms may be acute (sudden, developing ) or subacute (developing over weeks). The cause of transverse myelitis may be unknown (idiopathic) or it may be associated with a wide variety of underlying health problems, including infections, immune system disorders, and other inflammatory disorders. Tests that may be used to diagnose transverse myelitis include MRI to look for compression or inflammation , and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide. Some people have full or partial recovery from symptoms, while others do not recover any lost function . Most people recover at least partially, although recovery can take up to 2 or 3 years. In general however, if there is no improvement , a significant recovery is not likely.
103	If you're , get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years. That way, if your doctor finds glaucoma, you can start treatment , even if you dont have symptoms yet. Daily treatment will be needed to prevent vision loss. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. While glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater . How Glaucoma Develops There are several different types of glaucoma. Most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows , and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly , causing the pressure inside the eye to build. the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes vision loss. It usually happens when pressure eyeball damages the nerve in your eye (optic nerve). Vision loss usually happens slowly, so you may not notice it right away Glaucoma gets worse over time It can cause lasting vision loss and blindness if not treated Special eye drops (prescribed by your doctor) can lower the pressure in your eye Get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years to detect glaucoma early and help prevent vision loss If you have glaucoma, the doctor will need to check the pressure in your eyes often.
105	Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning . They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, . While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - -- are significantly impaired . Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. , dementia is not a normal part . To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined. A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person's medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, , and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. Neurological tests.
110	When acrocallosal syndrome is caused by KIF7 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies have mutations. The parents carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Acrocallosal syndrome (or severe Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant , which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur .
115	Similarities:For both COVID-19 and flu, it?s possible to spread the virus day before experiencing any symptoms. Differences: If a person has COVID-19, they may be contagious than if they had flu. Flu: Most people with flu are contagious for about 1 day before they show symptoms. Older children and adults with flu appear to be most contagious during the initial 3-4 days of their illness but many remain contagious . Infants and people with weakened immune systems can be contagious for even longer. How long someone can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 is still under investigation. It?s possible for people to spread the virus appeared. If someone is asymptomatic or their symptoms go away, it?s possible to remain contagious after testing positive for COVID-19. Duration . For most adults with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset* and for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms. Some adults with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions after symptom onset; severely immunocompromised patients** may produce replication-competent virus beyond 20 days and require additional testing and consultation with infectious diseases specialists and infection control experts. , isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Role of viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen)* ** to discontinue isolation or precautions. For adults who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation . For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur . Viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen)*** and quarantine . -confirmed COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic is not recommended if another exposure occurs or might have occurred within 90 days from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.
116	Some tips that may help reduce swelling:. . Put your legs on pillows to raise them above your heart while lying down. Exercise your legs. This helps pump fluid from your legs back to your heart. Follow a low-salt diet, which may reduce fluid buildup and swelling. Wear support stockings (sold at most drugstores and medical supply stores). When traveling, take breaks often to stand up and move around. Avoid wearing tight clothing or garters around your thighs. Lose weight if you need to. Follow your health care provider's treatment recommendations. If you have long-term swelling, ask your provider about options to prevent skin breakdown, such as. Flotation ring. Lamb's wool pad. Pressure-reducing mattress Continue . When lying down, keep your arms and legs , if possible, so the fluid can drain. DO NOT do this if you get shortness of breath. See your provider instead.
117	WHO is working closely with Ministries of Health, regional and national influenza research and surveillance centres, and other stakeholders to develop a multi-layered approach to preparing for and responding to both seasonal flu outbreaks and pandemics. Specific WHO programmes include the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, which helps developing countries access vaccines, antivirals, and diagnostics to both prepare for and manage pandemics. WHO and partners are developing a Global Influenza Strategy to be launched in 2 . Aligned (GPW13), the new strategy will support WHO Member States in developing seasonal influenza prevention and control capacities. These national efforts, in turn, will build greater global preparedness for the next pandemic. Globally, the strategy will focus . This will include improved influenza modelling and forecasting, along , including a possible universal influenza vaccine. This page links all WHO technical and general information on influenza. Pandemic Influenza outbreaks have been predictably unpredictable but always global, and needing a global response. One million people around the world died in a 1957 outbreak which started in China but spread globally. In 1968, another outbreak took 1 . In 2 , A(H5N1) or so-called Avian Influenza highlighted how the virus could pass from animals to humans, but it did not reach the pandemic stage because it did not pass . The 2 Swine flu A(H1N1) pandemic, started in Mexico and spread to over 214 countries and overseas territories or communities. The world was lucky: it turned out to be even milder . Researchers are always on the lookout, though, because the next outbreak could be far worse. WHO/SEARO/T.Pietrasik.
119	This Medication Guide does not take the place . Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about zoledronic acid injection. What is the most important information I should know about zoledronic acid injection? You should not receive zoledronic acid injection if you are already receiving Zometa. Both zoledronic acid injection and Zometa contain zoledronic acid. How will I receive zoledronic acid injection? Your doctor will tell you how often you will receive zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection is given by infusion into your vein (intravenously). Your infusion should last at least 15 minutes. Before you receive zoledronic acid injection, drink at least 2 glasses of fluid (such as water) within a few hours as directed by your doctor. It is a group of diseases that cause abnormal growth of connective tissue. In scleroderma, the tissue gets hard or thick. Symptoms of scleroderma include.
121	Using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 912 patients were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 5 mg twice daily). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so , including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of cefuroxime axetil tablet-treated patients was very similar at daily doses of 1, , 5 , and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence increased with the higher recommended doses. The following adverse events were thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to cefuroxime axetil tablets in multiple-dose clinical trials (n = 912 cefuroxime axetil-treated patients). . Cefuroxime comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours (twice a day) for 7-10 days. To treat gonorrhea, cefuroxime is taken as a single dose, and to treat Lyme disease, cefuroxime is taken twice a day for 20 days. The tablet may be taken , and the liquid must be taken with food. To help you remember to take cefuroxime, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefuroxime exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often . Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.
122	Being around certain things can raise your chances of cancer, including: Tobacco smoke: Lung, mouth, throat, esophagus, kidney, and bladder cancers Asbestos (a mineral fiber used for insulation and other building materials): Lung cancer and mesothelioma (cancer in the tissues that line your lungs) Sunlight: Skin cancer X-rays: Leukemia and cancer in the organ exposed to radiation Radon (a radioactive gas that comes from the ground and can build up ): Lung cancer Some chemicals used at work (such as benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride) can cause cancer. Geography (where you live) can affect your chances of getting cancer. One reason is that people in different areas may be exposed . Another reason is that people in different areas may have different genetic risk factors. Genes are the instructions that tell each of your cells what to do. Genes tell cells when to grow, when to stop growing, and what substances to make. For example, certain genes tell cells in your stomach to make stomach acid. Sometimes one of your genes can go bad in ways that make a cell turn cancerous. A gene can go bad if: The gene was damaged by something you were exposed to (an environmental factor) The gene was copied incorrectly , you inherited a cancer gene . Sometimes people in a family are more likely to have a certain cancer. A cancer-causing gene could run in that family. One cancer-causing gene called . BRCA. increases the risk of breast cancer. Not being physically active. Women have a higher risk of getting breast cancer. Being overweight or obese after menopause. Older women have a higher risk of getting breast cancer . Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancer risk. Studies show that a woman?s risk for breast cancer increases with the more alcohol she drinks. Research suggests that other factors such as smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones also may increase breast cancer risk.
125	Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body. Lupus occurs when the immune system, which normally helps protect the body , attacks its own tissues. This attack causes inflammation, and in some cases permanent tissue damage, which can be widespread affecting the skin, joints, heart, lung, kidneys, circulating blood cells, and brain. If you have lupus, you may experience periods of illness (flares) and periods of wellness (remission). Lupus flares can be mild to serious,and they are unpredictable. However, with treatment, many people with lupus can manage the disease. Most people can usually participate they did before they were diagnosed. . Pregnancy and Contraception . Most women with lupus can have healthy pregnancies if the disease is under control. If you start to plan a pregnancy, talk to your doctor so you can be as healthy as possible before becoming pregnant. Close monitoring during pregnancy is essential, especially if you have low platelets, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, high blood pressure, lung or heart problems, or kidney disease. Researchers are exploring possible triggers for lupus. Treatment. Scientists are exploring how lupus develops and how therapies affect the course of the disease. They are also exploring drugs to prevent or delay kidney failure, one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of lupus. Experts are also collaborating to develop registries and working groups, such as: The Lupus Family Registry and Repository, which gathers medical information as well as blood and tissue samples from patients and their relatives.

129	Summary : A suprapubic catheter (tube) drains urine from your bladder. It is inserted into your bladder . You may need a catheter because you have urinary incontinence (leakage), urinary retention (not being able to urinate), surgery that made a catheter necessary, or another health problem. What to Expect at Home : Your catheter will make it easier for you to drain your bladder and avoid infections. You will need to make sure it is working properly. You will also need to know how to change it. You will need to change it every 4 to 6 weeks. You can learn how to change your catheter in a sterile (very clean) way. Avoid physical activity . It is best to keep the catheter taped to your belly. Once your catheter is in place, you will need to empty your urine bag only a few times a day. Caring for Your Skin Near your Catheter : Follow these guidelines . Check the catheter site a few times a day. You are leaking urine. You will need to check your catheter and bag throughout the day. Always keep your bag below your waist. Try not to disconnect the catheter more than you need to. Keeping it connected to the bag will make it work better. Check for kinks, and move the tubing around if it is not draining. Drink plenty of water during the day to keep urine flowing.
131	There are many possible causes of numbness and tingling, including: Sitting or standing in the same position for a long time, Injuring a nerve (a neck injury may cause you to feel numbness anywhere along your arm or hand, while a low back injury can cause numbness or tingling down the back of your leg), Pressure on the nerves of the spine, such as from a herniated disk, Pressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors, scar tissue, or infection, Shingles or herpes zoster infection, Other infections such as HIV/AIDS, leprosy, syphilis, or tuberculosis, Lack of blood supply to an area, such as from hardening of the arteries, frostbite, or vessel inflammation, Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body, Deficiency of B vitamins such as B1, B6, B12, or folic acid, Use of certain medicines, Use of certain illicit street drugs, Nerve damage due to lead, alcohol, or tobacco, or from chemotherapy drugs, Radiation therapy, Animal bites, Insect, tick, mite, and spider bites, Seafood toxins, Congenital conditions that affect the nerves. Numbness and tingling can be caused , including: Carpal tunnel syndrome (pressure ), Diabetes Migraines Multiple sclerosis Seizures Stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a "mini-stroke", Underactive thyroid Raynaud phenomenon (narrowing , ). See your regular doctor or foot doctor right away: Pain . Tingling, burning, or pain in your feet. Loss to feel heat or cold very well. A change over time. Fungus infections such as athlete?s foot between your toes. A blister, sore, ulcer, infected corn, or ingrown toenail. Most people with diabetes can prevent serious foot complications. Regular care at home and going to all doctor?s appointments are your best bet for preventing foot problems (and stopping small problems from becoming serious ones).More Information Diabetes and Foot Problemsexternal icon Diabetes Features &amp; Spotlights CDC Diabetes on Facebook @CDCDiabetes on Twitter. Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations , but they are often felt . Some people with nerve damage have numbness, tingling, or pain, but others have no symptoms. Nerve damage can also lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold. Living without pain sounds pretty good, but it comes . Pain is the body?s way of telling you something?s wrong so you can take care of yourself. you can do to prevent nerve damage or stop it from getting worse? Keep your blood sugar as much as possible. Other good diabetes management habits can help, too: Don?t smoke. Smoking reduces blood flow to the feet. Follow a healthy eating plan, including eating more fruits and vegetables and less sugar and salt.
133	Steps for first aid treatment of a crush injury are: Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure. Cover the area . Then, raise the area , if possible. If there is suspicion of a head, neck, or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement . Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or local hospital for further advice. Crush injuries most often need to be evaluated . Surgery may be needed. Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Ice your elbow . Wrap the ice in cloth. DO NOT place ice directly on the skin. Cold from the ice can damage your skin. Compress the area by wrapping it . Elevate your elbow by raising it . You can prop it up with pillows. You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. You may need to wear a sling, splint, or cast while your elbow heals. Depending on how badly it is sprained, you may need to work with a physical therapist who will show you stretching and strengthening exercises. Most people recover completely from a simple elbow sprain .
136	Almost everyone has pain . Most of the time, it is not serious. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain. For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps . Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get medical care right away. Sometimes, you may only need to call a health care provider if your symptoms continue. Sometimes, abdominal pain may occur . For example, you may have abdominal pain if you have Urinary tract infections Call your health care provider if: Waking to urinate more often continues over several days. You are bothered by the number of times you must urinate during the night. You have a burning sensation when urinating.
140	However, laboratory tests may help a doctor determine whether depression is caused . People who have severely disturbed sleep may need to have testing (polysomnography) to distinguish sleep disorders from depression. The risk factors for depression are family history, life experiences, and environment. For example, some older adults who are at risk may have hardening and inflammation , and blood may not be able to flow normally to the body's organs, including the brain. If this happens, an older adult with no family history of depression may develop what some doctors call "vascular depression. " Older adults may also experience depression as a result of brain changes caused by illnesses such as Alzheimers disease or Parkinsons disease. This type of depression can appear , before many symptoms appear. Certain medicines and some health problems (such as viruses or a thyroid disorder) can cause the same symptoms as depression. Sometimes depression can be part . Diagnosis of depression includes a mental health professional asking questions . To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present . A person diagnosed may have episodes of major depression , but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder. Women with postpartum depression experience full-blown major depression (postpartum depression). Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression. Depression is one suggests that depression is caused . Depression can happen at any age, but often begins in adulthood. Depression is now recognized , . These conditions are often worse when depression is present. Sometimes medications taken may cause side effects that contribute to depression. Risk factors include: Personal or family history of depression, Major life changes, trauma, or stress, Certain physical illnesses and medications.
141	, one other flu vaccine is licensed specifically for people 65 years and older. The high-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent) contains four times the amount of antigen as the standard-dose inactivated flu vaccine, and has been associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination and better effectiveness than the regular dose flu vaccine in older people in a two-season randomized trial. People may also receive standard-dose, flu vaccines without adjuvant or the recombinant flu vaccine. People 65 years and older can get any flu vaccine approved with no preference for any one vaccine over another. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others. The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. There are different types of flu shots, . Ask your health care provider which one is right for you. Everyone should get a flu vaccine every season. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine. Other exceptions are people who have Had reactions to flu shots before Guillain-Barre Syndrome A fever Centers . , FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent are licensed only for persons aged 65 years and older.

Information about vaccine ingredients is located in package inserts from each manufacturer.
142	Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Diabetes means your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Too much glucose in your blood is not good for you or your baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed in the 24th . Managing your gestational diabetes can help you and your baby stay healthy. You can protect your own and your baby's health by taking action right away to manage your blood glucose levels. Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can't make the extra insulin needed during pregnancy. Insulin, a hormone made in your pancreas, helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels. During pregnancy, your body makes special hormones and goes through other changes, such as weight gain. All pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. These women develop gestational diabetes. Being overweight or obese is linked to gestational diabetes. Women may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.
143	Metoprolol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - tiredness - depression - nausea - dry mouth - stomach pain - vomiting - gas or bloating - heartburn - constipation - rash or itching - cold hands and feet - runny nose Some side effects can be serious. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately: - shortness of breath - wheezing - swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs - weight gain - fainting - rapid, pounding, or irregular heartbeat Metoprolol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-8 -332-1 ). Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems . But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions. One problem is interactions, which may occur between Two drugs, such Drugs and food, , such Drugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers Interactions can change the actions . The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects. Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, , and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious. Drug allergies are another type of reaction.
144	The most common cause of lactic acidosis is severe medical illness in which blood pressure is low and too little oxygen is reaching the bodys tissues. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary cause lactic acidosis. Certain diseases can also cause the condition including: AIDS Alcoholism Cancer Cirrhosis Cyanide poisoning Kidney failure Respiratory failure Sepsis (severe infection) Some medicines can rarely cause lactic acidosis: Certain inhalers used to treat asthma or COPD Epinephrine An antibiotic called linezolid Metformin, used to treat diabetes (most often when overdosed) One type of medicine used to treat HIV infection Propofol. Lactic acidosis refers to lactic acid build up in the bloodstream. Lactic acid is produced when oxygen levels, become low where metabolism takes place. The main treatment for lactic acidosis is to correct the medical problem that causes the condition.
145	For people who are :. Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years . What affects my cholesterol levels?. A variety of things can affect cholesterol levels. These are some things you can do to lower your cholesterol levels: Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise. HDL helps to remove bad cholesterol from your arteries. So a lower HDL can contribute to a higher level of bad cholesterol. Things outside of your control that can also affect cholesterol levels include: Age and Gender. It carries cholesterol back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body. . What are the treatments for high cholesterol?. If you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you to lower your cholesterol level. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. You should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines. . Who needs cholesterol medicines?. Your health care provider may prescribe medicine if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher . What are the different types of medicines for cholesterol?. Combination medicines, which include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine There are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) who have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited disorder that causes high LDL cholesterol. . How does my health care provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take?. When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your health care provider will consider Your cholesterol levels Your risk Your age Any other health problems you have Possible side effects of the medicines. Higher doses are more likely to cause side effects, especially over time.
148	A heart attack is when blood flow to part of your heart is suddenly blocked and some of your heart muscle dies. Doctors use the term myocardial infarction to refer to a heart attack. Myocardium is a word for heart muscle, and infarction is a word for blocked blood flow. So a myocardial infarction is a heart attack. Go if you think you're having a heart attack You may have chest pressure, shortness of breath, and a tired feeling if you're having a heart problem Sometimes a heart attack may cause mild symptoms or none at all (silent heart attack) Doctors do blood tests and ECG/EKG if you have symptoms of a heart attack Doctors will give you medicine and do procedures to try to get more blood to the affected area of your heart. Blood Flow to the Heart Is Blocked The heart works 24 hours a day, pumping oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body. Blood is supplied to the heart . , it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks. Prompt Treatment Is Important Heart attack treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Prompt treatment of a heart attack can help prevent or limit damage to the heart and prevent sudden death. Call 9-1-1 Right Away A heart attack is an emergency. Angina is a recurring pain or discomfort in the chest that happens when some part of the heart does not receive enough blood. An episode of angina is not a heart attack. However, people with angina may have a hard time telling the difference between angina and heart attack symptoms. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle does not get enough blood. The pain may also occur . Having a heart attack increases your chances of having another one. The emergency action plan should include - warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack - instructions for accessing emergency medical services in your community, including calling 9-1-1 - steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive, such as taking aspirin and nitroglycerin - important information to take along with you to the hospital, that you take or that you are allergic to, and name and number of whom you should contact if you go to the hospital.
151	A vegetarian diet does not include any meat, poultry, or seafood. It is a meal plan made up . A vegetarian diet contains no animal proteins. , keep in mind the following: Eat different kinds of foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy and eggs if your diet includes these. Choose fortified foods, such as cereals, breads, soy or almond milk, and fruits juices to get a full range of nutrients. Limit foods that are high in sugar, salt (sodium), and fat. Include a protein source with all meals. If needed, take supplements if your diet lacks certain vitamins and minerals. Learn to read the Nutrition Facts Label on food packages. The label tells you the ingredients and nutrition contents . If you follow a more restrictive diet, you may want to work with a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough nutrients. People who follow vegetarian diets can get all the nutrients they need. However, they must be careful to eat a wide variety of foods to meet their nutritional needs. Nutrients vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12.
152	Symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome often include a characteristic high-pitched, mewing cry that sounds like a kitten crying. This cry may be heard immediately after birth, lasts several weeks, and then disappears. However, not all affected newborns have this distinct cry. An infant with this syndrome may have a low birth weight and a small head , including a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. Often the infant seems limp. Webbed fingers and toes (syndactyly) and heart defects are common. There are significant limitations . Many children with cri du chat syndrome survive to adulthood but have substantial disabilities. Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused . Most cases are believed to occur . A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form . Most cases of cri-du-chat syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history . About 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality . In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed . Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement . Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material .
153	Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is a rare blood cell cancer characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells . These individuals are diagnosed with smoldering (or asymptomatic) Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia. Individuals can experience general symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Several other signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the excess IgM, which can thicken blood and impair circulation, causing a condition known as hyperviscosity syndrome. Blood tests Additional laboratory tests Blood tests are done when macroglobulinemia is suspected. MYD88. , commonly occur among patients with macroglobulinemia. A bone marrow biopsy may reveal an increased number of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which helps confirm the diagnosis of macroglobulinemia, and the appearance of these cells helps differentiate this disorder from multiple myeloma. Symptoms may include any of the following. Another gene commonly associated , is mutated in approximately 30 percent of affected individuals (most of whom also have the MYD88 gene mutation). Other genetic changes believed to be involved in Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia have not yet been identified. The mutations that cause Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present . Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a chronic, slow-growing lymphoproliferative disorder. It usually affects older adults and is primarily found , although lymph nodes and the spleen may be involved. Treatment is often reserved and may include various medications including corticosteroids , alkylating agents, biologic response modifiers and purine analogues. For individuals who do not have any symptoms, doctors may decide to "watch and wait" and not treat the disease right away. There are also several new drugs and drug combinations that are being studied in clinical trials. More detailed information about the specific medications used to treat Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site. Many people who have macroglobulinemia have no symptoms, and the disorder is discovered by chance when an elevated level of blood proteins is found . Other people have symptoms resulting from interference with blood flow to the skin, fingers, toes, nose, and brain that occurs when the large quantity of macroglobulins thickens the blood (hyperviscosity syndrome). These symptoms include bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes (such as the lining of the mouth, nose, and digestive tract), fatigue, weakness, headache, confusion, dizziness, and even coma. People who have macroglobulinemia may also have swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged liver and spleen . These disorders include cancers , autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and infections by such organisms as hepatitis C virus.
155	There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. AMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. There are two types of AMD: Dry AMD occurs . Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that causes the macula to lose its normal structure (called degeneration). AMD is more common in older people In severe cases, it can lead to blindness. Certain vitamins may help slow vision loss from AMD. First you get: Dry AMD, in which cells in the macula die slowly and cause a steady loss of vision. After you have had dry AMD for a while, you might get: Wet AMD, in which new abnormal blood vessels grow , causing faster vision loss Viewing the Retina. Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area , called the macula, . The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known (atrophy), resulting . Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, . , the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease characterized . These new and abnormal blood vessels leak fluid into the macula and cause macular edema.
158	Stool that comes from your ileostomy is thin or thick liquid, or it may be pasty. It is not solid . Foods you eat, medicines you take, and other things may change how thin or thick your stool is. If you believe a certain food has caused a change in your stools, do not eat it for a while, and then try again. Call your provider if: You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.
160	Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Diabetes is a disease caused by high levels of blood sugar (glucose) in your body. Over time, this extra glucose can lead to prediabetes or diabetes. Genetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified . Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops in a woman who does not already have diabetes. If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact to cause diabetes. But when insulin production falters , glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Abnormal Glucose Production by the Liver In some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase also contributes to high blood glucose levels. And the more you smoke the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems if you already have diabetes. Quitting smoking can also help you control your blood sugar levels. Being a healthy weight and not smoking can help all women be healthier. But, obesity and smoking do not always cause diabetes. Some women or smoke never develop diabetes. Also, women can develop diabetes if they have other risk factors, such as a family history of diabetes. Most cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. Other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.
161	More than one half can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. The outlook is poor if the cancer comes back after a remission or does not go into remission . Without timely treatment, BL is rapidly fatal. However, the majority of people treated with aggressive therapy achieve long-term remission . In general, children with BL have better survival rates . The prognosis in children correlates . Those with limited disease when diagnosed and treated have a survival rate greater than 90%. Children , especially involving the bone marrow and central nervous system , have long-term survival rates of 50-90%. While the majority of adults with BL also achieve long-term remission with aggressive therapy, adults (particularly those ) do more poorly than children. , prognosis depends . Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL). NHL's are cancers that affect the the lymphatic system (part ). In MCL, there are cancerous B-cells (a type ). The cancerous B-cells are within a region of the lymph node known . Although MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed. In these situations, treatment must be intensive since MCL can become life threatening . MCL accounts for 6% of all NHL's and is mostly found in males . Low-grade NHL often cannot be cured by chemotherapy alone. Low-grade NHL progresses slowly and may take many years before the disease gets worse or even requires treatment. The need for treatment is usually determined by symptoms, how fast the disease is progressing, and if blood counts are low. Chemotherapy may cure many types of high-grade lymphomas. If the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy, the disease can cause rapid death. Follicular lymphoma is located primarily , but can also involve the spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and Waldeyer's ring. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnoses include chronic lymphocytic B cell leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and MALT lymphoma (see these terms). Management and treatment If the lymphoma is localized it should be treated by radiotherapy. In the case of advanced stage lymphoma, chemotherapy with immuno-chemotherapy should be offered (rituximab combined with CHOP).
165	Your provider will examine you and carefully check your elbow. You will be asked about your medical history and symptoms such as: Are both elbows affected? Does the pain shift from the elbow to other joints? Is the pain prominence of the elbow? Did the pain begin suddenly and severely? Did the pain begin slowly and mildly and then get worse? Is the pain getting better on its own? Did the pain begin after an injury? What makes the pain better or worse? Is there pain that goes from the elbow down to the hand? Treatment depends on the cause, but may involve: Antibiotics Corticosteroid shots Manipulation Pain medicine Physical therapy Surgery (last resort). Gently try to move the elbow and increase your range of motion. If this hurts or you cannot move the elbow, call your health care provider. Call your provider if: You have a prolonged case of tendinitis that doesn't improve with home care. The pain is due to a direct elbow injury. There is obvious deformity. You can't use the elbow. You have fever or swelling and redness of your elbow. Your elbow is locked and can't straighten or bend. A child has elbow pain. Elbow pain can be caused by many problems. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. This condition is also called an elbow subluxation (a partial dislocation). Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Ice your elbow . Elevate your elbow by raising it . You can prop it up with pillows. You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling.
166	Clear Eyes Pure Relief for DRY EYES Glycerin / Lubricant Eye Drops 0.34 FL OZ (10 mL). Diagnosis of dry eye requires a comprehensive eye evaluation. Your eye care professional will ask you about your symptoms, your overall health (conditions for which you are treated, medications that you take), your eye history (use of contact lenses, past refractive or other eye surgery), and aspects of your daily environment (exposure to environmental allergens or occupational hazards). He or she will test your vision, check your eye pressure, examine your eyelids and front eye structures, and if necessary may dilate the pupils to examine the inside of the eye. Your eye care professional may order a tearing test to find out if your eyes are producing enough tears to keep them moist. , called a Schirmers test, the doctor may measure your tear production by placing strips of blotting paper , usually done after numbing the eye with anesthetic drops. , the doctor removes the strips and measures the amount of tear production. Murine Tears For DRY EYES Lubricant Eye Drops Original Natural Tears Formula ? Moisture Enriched ? Eye Doctor Recommended 0.5 fl oz. (15 mL).  for use as a protectant against further irritation or dryness of the eye.
169	There are a number . Less common causes include: A hernia in the groin (inguinal hernia), Infection of the testis (orchitis), usually caused by mumps or another virus, Pain from a disorder in the abdomen (such as a kidney stone or appendicitis), Injury Dangerous disorders that sometimes cause scrotal pain include a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and necrotizing infection and anuscalled Fournier gangrene. Cancer of a testis only rarely causes pain. Testicular torsion causes: Severe pain Feeling sick and throwing up Fever Needing to urinate often.
170	Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems (ataxia). Delayed development becomes noticeable , and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as "coarse." Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Most individuals with Angelman syndrome will have severe developmental delays, speech limitations, and motor difficulties. However, individuals with Angelman syndrome can have normal life spans and generally do not show developmental regression as they age. Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy . Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect that controls activation . UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15.The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown . In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted . However, loss does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. There is no cure for Angelman syndrome. Treatment helps to manage health and development problems caused by the condition. Anticonvulsant medicines help control seizures Behavior therapy helps manage hyperactivity, sleep problems, and development problems Occupational and speech therapy manage speech problems and teach living skills Physical therapy helps . Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic condition that causes problems with the way a child's body and brain develop. The syndrome is present from birth (congenital). This is when development problems are first noticed in most cases.
174	Crusted scabies (also called Norwegian scabies) is an infestation characterized by thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs. It is a severe form of scabies that occurs most often in people who have a weakened immune system or a neurological disease, the elderly, and the disabled. The symptoms , , may be absent. Crusted scabies is very contagious and can spread both by direct skin-to-skin contact and through contaminated items such as clothing, bedding, and furniture. It is caused by super-infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis, a mite . People with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent future outbreaks of scabies. Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic infections, is commonly used for treatment. Crusted scabies may be particularly difficult to treat. Patients with crusted scabies may be instructed by their doctors to remove scaling skin so that topical medications can penetrate the skin more easily. Repeated applications or combined treatment may be necessary. Patients who still have signs of infection after one month may need additional treatment. Infants and pregnant women should be treated for scabies only if the benefit is determined to outweigh the risk and if the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy . A dermatologist or infectious disease physician should be involved with whom they have had close contact. Treatment of crusted scabies should be done , . Scabies is an itchy skin condition caused . Scabies spreads quickly in crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people. Hospitals, child-care centers, and nursing homes are examples. Scabies can easily infect sex partners and other household members. Sharing clothes, towels, and bedding can sometimes spread scabies. This can happen much more easily when the infested person has crusted scabies. You cannot get scabies from a pet. Pets get a different mite infection called mange. Scabies is an itchy rash. The mites get into your skin and lay eggs. Doctors treat scabies with a medicated cream.
175	If there's a health problem causing your hair loss, doctors treat that problem. They also treat hair loss with: Medicine for male and female pattern baldness, which can take 8 to 12 months to work Hair transplants to move hair follicles . Summary. You lose up to 1 hairs from your scalp every day. That's normal, and in most people, those hairs grow back. But many men -- and some women -- lose hair as they grow older. You can also lose your hair if you have certain diseases, such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or lupus. If you take certain medicines or have chemotherapy for cancer, you may also lose your hair. Other causes are stress, a low protein diet, a family history, or poor nutrition. Treatment for hair loss depends on the cause. In some cases, treating the underlying cause will correct the problem. Other treatments include medicines and hair restoration. Wigs often offer the best treatment for temporary hair loss (for example, that caused by chemotherapy). People undergoing chemotherapy should consult a wig maker even before therapy begins so that an appropriate wig can be ready when needed. When hair regrows, it may be different from the original hair.
176	No treatment can reverse the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa. Vitamin A palmitate may help slow the progression . Supplements with an omega-3 fatty acid (for example, docosahexaenoic acid) and a combination of lutein plus zeaxanthin may also slow the rate of vision loss. People who have swelling of the retina (macular edema), drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (usually acetazolamide or dorzolamide) are given . A new gene-therapy drug called voretigene neparovovec-ryzl may restore some vision , provided they still have some retinal cells capable of surviving and reproducing. People who have lost all vision or almost all vision can be given a surgically implanted computer chip in the eye, which can restore some perception . Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. However, taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects appear to be relatively weak. Studies have explored potential treatment with DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish. While DHA is known to play a structural role in retinal cells , more research is needed to determine whether supplements should be recommended. Current research is focused on the development of new treatments including gene therapy , retinal transplantation, and the use . Stem cell transplantation would involve the injection and integration of stem cells into the retina, in hopes these cells will replace dead cells and provide the missing enzymes and chemicals needed for sight. Gene therapy could potentially be used when the disease-causing mutation is known and would aim to restore production . Studies with retinal prosthetics have tested devices that transform light into electrical signals that can be sent directly , avoiding the diseased part . Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes cells in the retina to die, causing progressive vision loss. The first sign of RP usually is night blindness. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), and eventually loss of central vision. RP may be caused . Inheritance can be autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , or X-linked . Treatment options to slow the progression of vision loss include light avoidance, use of low-vision aids, and vitamin A supplementation. Researchers are working to develop new treatment options for the future such as gene therapy , stem cell transplantation and prosthetic implants. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina which is the light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye.
178	Leg pain can be due to a muscle cramp (also called a charley horse). Common causes of cramps include: Dehydration or low amounts in the blood Medicines (such as diuretics and statins) Muscle fatigue or strain from overuse, too much exercise, or holding a muscle in the same position for a long time An injury can also cause leg pain from: A torn or overstretched muscle (strain) Hairline crack in the bone (stress fracture) Inflamed tendon (tendinitis) Shin splints (pain in the front of the leg from overuse). Other common causes of leg pain include: Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which causes a problem (this type of pain, called claudication, is generally felt when exercising or walking and is relieved by rest) Blood clot (deep vein thrombosis) from long-term bed rest Infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or skin and soft tissue (cellulitis), Inflammation of the leg joints caused , Nerve damage common , Varicose veins. Less common causes include: Cancerous bone tumors (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma), Legg-Calve-Perthes disease: Poor blood flow to the hip that may stop or slow the normal growth of the leg, Noncancerous (benign) tumors or cysts of the femur or tibia (osteoid osteoma), Sciatic nerve pain (radiating pain down the leg) caused by a slipped disk in the back. If you have a muscle cramp, stop your activity and try stretching and massaging the muscle. Heat will relax the muscle when the spasm begins, but ice may be helpful when the pain has improved. , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can help with pain. If the muscle cramps are severe, your health care provider can prescribe other medicines. The most common cause of muscle cramps during sports activity is not getting enough fluids. Often, drinking water will ease the cramping. Other tips for relieving muscle cramps. Some disorders cause symptoms that resemble muscle cramps. Dystonias. are involuntary muscle contractions, but they usually last longer . In contrast, benign leg cramps and exercise-associated muscle cramping tend to affect the calf muscles. Tetany. The muscles may also twitch. Illusory muscle cramps. These people feel as if they are having cramps but no muscle contraction occurs. Hardening . This pain is due as occurs with cramps. Leg cramps are common. The most common causes are benign leg cramps and exercise-associated cramping. Stretching and not consuming caffeine can help prevent muscle cramps. Drug therapy is not usually recommended to prevent muscle cramps.
180	 How often do you have pain and how long does it last? How often do you have diarrhea? Have you been traveling? Have you been taking antibiotics recently? Your provider may recommend a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. During this test, a flexible tube is inserted through the rectum to examine the colon. Other studies that can identify colitis include: CT scan of the abdomen MRI of the abdomen Barium enema Stool culture Stool examination . Colitis is swelling (inflammation) of the large intestine (colon). A physical exam may help diagnose ulcerative colitis. A health care provider may order lab tests to help diagnose ulcerative colitis, including blood and stool tests. Once the scope reaches the end , the health care provider slowly withdraws it . If the health care provider suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. To make the diagnosis of hemorrhagic colitis, a doctor has stool specimens tested for strains of . E. coli. or the toxins they produce. If not controlled, it can be cured by surgically removing the colon. Computed tomography (CT) or sometimes colonoscopy A doctor may suspect ischemic colitis . It is important for doctors to distinguish ischemic colitis from acute mesenteric ischemia, a more dangerous condition in which blood flow is completely and irreversibly blocked. Doctors usually do CT or sometimes also colonoscopy (examination ) to distinguish ischemic colitis . People with ulcerative colitis should talk about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. Screening can include colonoscopy with biopsies or a special dye spray called chromoendoscopy. Health care providers may recommend colonoscopy with ulcerative colitis who havethe disease in one-third or more or of their colon had ulcerative colitis for 8 years. Such screening does not reduce a person's chances of developing colon cancer. Instead, screening can help diagnose cancer early and improve chances for recovery. Surgery to remove the entire colon eliminates the risk of colon cancer.
181	The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear . This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection. Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called "referred" pain. Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term ear infection, Long-term ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes), Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax, Hole in the eardrum, Sinus infection, Sore throat, Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ), Tooth infection, Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection. Other causes may include: Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, . Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity , or nausea. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. Sinus headache causes pain . It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse . An earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain . The pain may last a short time or be ongoing. Related conditions include: Otitis media Swimmer's ear Malignant otitis externa.
182	You may need this procedure if you have damage to the cartilage: In the knee joint, Under the kneecap. This will help prevent knee arthritis. It can help you delay the need for a partial or total knee replacement. This procedure is also used to treat knee pain . Some knee problems, such as those resulting from an accident, can't be prevented. However, people can prevent many knee problems by doing the following: Before exercising or participating in sports, warm up by walking or riding a stationary bicycle, then do stretches. Obesity increases the risk of osteoarthritis of the knee. Being overweight puts you at greater risk for knee problems. Overusing your knee can trigger knee problems that cause pain. If you have a history of arthritis, it could also cause knee pain. Here are some common causes of knee pain: MEDICAL CONDITIONS Arthritis. A fluid-filled swelling behind the knee that may occur with swelling (inflammation) from other causes, like arthritis. Other areas of research involve trying to understand better and the measures that should be taken to prevent them, investigating the role of exercise in protecting the knee, and developing less invasive surgeries and better joint prostheses. Holding the Knee Together The collateral ligaments, one on either side of the knee, prevent the knee . The cruciate ligaments inside the joint prevent the knee from moving forward or backward too much. Rheumatoid arthritis is another type of arthritis that affects the knee. In rheumatoid arthritis, your knee becomes inflamed and cartilage may be destroyed. Simple causes of knee pain often clear while you take steps to manage your symptoms. If knee pain is caused , you should contact your health care provider. If your knee pain has just started and is not severe, you can: Rest and avoid activities that cause pain.
183	A Bartholin abscess forms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. These glands are found . Soaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. It can also help the abscess open and drain on its own. However, the opening is often very small and closes quickly. Therefore, the abscess often returns. Women can be treated with a minor surgery called marsupialization. The procedure involves creating an elliptical opening along the cyst to help the gland drain. Practice good hygiene. Eat soft or liquid foods until the abscess has healed. Avoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods can also help. The chance is excellent. The abscesses may return in few cases. It is important to treat any vaginal infection that is diagnosed . Your provider may recommend that the glands be completely removed if abscesses keep coming back.
184	Gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) insertion is done in part using a procedure called endoscopy. This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube . The endoscope is inserted . After the endoscopy tube is inserted, the skin over the left side of belly (abdomen) area is cleaned and numbed. The doctor makes a small surgical cut in this area. The G-tube is inserted through this cut into the stomach. The tube is small, flexible, and hollow. The doctor uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube. Wash . Clean as you can. Do not wash or rub the stitches directly. Dab the site dry . Do not rub the area. Avoid using the towel directly on the stitches. If there was a bandage over the stitches, replace it , if instructed to do so. Your provider should also tell you when you need to have a wound checked and the stitches removed. If not, contact your provider for an appointment. A gastrostomy feeding tube insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall. It goes directly into the stomach.
185	Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain. The painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. TN pain is typically felt . There is some evidence . The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. TN may be part but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a type of chronic pain that affects your face. It usually affects one side of the face. Any vibration , can set it off. TN usually affects people . The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing . Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown. There is no single test to diagnose TN. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain. The pain of TN comes . This nerve carries the sensations from the face, eyes, sinuses, and mouth to the brain. Trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by: Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering myelin of the nerves Pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or tumor Injury to the trigeminal nerve, such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery Often, no exact cause is found. TN usually affects adults above age 50 years, but it can occur at any age. When TN affects people younger than 40, it is often due to MS or a tumor.
188	Experts recommend that people eat a balanced diet to obtain most nutrients. More information can be found on the National Agricultural Library website at www.nutrition.gov. Dietary Supplements Iodine is an essential mineral for the thyroid. However, people may be sensitive from iodine. Taking iodine drops or eating foods containing large amounts of iodinesuch cause or worsen hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. More information about iodine can be found fact sheet Iodine in diet, available at www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/ .htm. Women need more iodine when they are pregnantabout 250 micrograms a day because the baby gets iodine . , about 7 percent of pregnant women may not get enough iodine in their diet or through prenatal vitamins.3 Choosing iodized salt salt supplemented with iodineover plain salt and prenatal vitamins containing iodine will ensure this need is met. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use . Doctors treat hypothyroidism with: Thyroid hormone pills After you start the pills, your doctor will gradually adjust the dose . It's important to talk to your doctor about medicines that interfere with absorbing thyroid hormone. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening complication in which breathing slows, seizures occur, and blood flow to the brain decreases. Myxedema coma can be triggered in a person with hypothyroidism . Spotlight on Aging: Hypothyroidism in Older People Many older people have some degree of hypothyroidism. About 10% of women and 6% of men are affected. Typical symptoms, such as weight gain, muscle cramps, tingling of the hands, and the inability to tolerate cold, are less common among older people. Older people may also have less typical symptoms. Because symptoms in older people can be different, are often subtle and vague, and are common among older people who do not have hypothyroidism, doctors may not recognize these symptoms as being caused by hypothyroidism. A screening test, in which blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone are measured, is important. The test should be done at age 65 even if people have no symptoms of hypothyroidism.
190	There are three types of Usher syndrome: People with type I are deaf from birth and have severe balance problems . Usher syndrome is the most common condition that affects both hearing and vision. The major symptoms of Usher syndrome are hearing loss and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, or RP. Photograph of the retina of a patient with Usher syndrome (left) compared (right). Usher syndrome is a condition characterized by hearing loss or deafness and progressive vision loss. This type of Usher syndrome also includes problems with the inner ear that affect balance. The hearing loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects high tones. Type 1 Usher syndrome: MY , USH1C, CDH23, PCHD15, SANS. Type 2 Usher syndrome: USH2A, VLGR1, WHRN. Type 3 Usher syndrome: USH3A With so many possible genes involved in Usher syndrome, genetic tests for the disorder are not conducted . Diagnosis of Usher syndrome is usually performed . Usher syndrome is inherited, which means that it is passed from parents to their children through genes. If both parents are carriers of a mutated gene for Usher syndrome, they will have a one-in-four chance of having a child with Usher syndrome with each birth. Usually, parents who have normal hearing and vision do not know if they are carriers of an Usher syndrome gene mutation. Currently, it is not possible to determine whether an individual who does not have a family history of Usher syndrome is a carrier. Because Usher syndrome affects hearing, balance, and vision, diagnosis of the disorder usually includes the evaluation . Early diagnosis of Usher syndrome is very important. The earlier that parents know if their child has Usher syndrome, the sooner that child can begin special educational training programs to manage the loss . If a child is diagnosed with type 1 Usher syndrome early on, before he or she loses the ability to see, that child is more likely to benefit from the full spectrum of intervention strategies that can help him or her participate more fully in life s activities. Type 2: Children with type 2 Usher syndrome are born with moderate to severe hearing loss and normal balance.
191	Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form . Researchers classify junctional epidermolysis bullosa into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. , their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused . Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion , abnormalities , joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). , infants with this condition usually do not survive . The milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa is called non-Herlitz JEB. The blistering associated with non-Herlitz JEB may be limited , and it often improves . Other characteristic features of this condition include alopecia, malformed fingernails and toenails, and irregular tooth enamel. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group . It is passed down in families. Your provider will let you know , what type to use. You may need to use oral steroid medicines if you have swallowing problems. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection . Take good care and get regular dental check-ups. It is best to see a dentist who has experience treating people with EB. Eat a healthy diet. When you have a lot of skin injury, you may need extra calories and protein to help your skin heal. Do exercises a physical therapist shows you to help keep your joints and muscles mobile. SURGERY. Surgery to treat this condition may include: Skin grafting in places where sores are deep Dilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing Repair of hand deformities Removal of any squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that develops OTHER TREATMENTS. Other treatments for this condition may include: Medicines that suppress the immune system may be used .
192	. Proposed uses. include Pain relief, including and vomiting that commonly occur during pregnancy or after surgery or chemotherapy Treatment of addiction, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, low back pain, fatigue, and joint pain Acupuncture research is inherently difficult to conduct. Blinding (preventing research subjects and practitioners from knowing which people were given which treatment) is challenging in acupuncture studies. So-called "sham" acupuncture (insertion other than those used in acupuncture) often puts pressure on acupressure points, making measuring acupuncture effects difficult. This may reflect bias, but it could also be that these providers are practicing the full schema of traditional Chinese medicine of which acupuncture is only a component. Acupuncture is effective in treating several disorders and symptoms, though further study is needed. Comparing acupuncture to the control practice of sham acupuncture is complicated because the comparison therapy is still a relaxation practice with a provider. The placebo for acupuncture may involve using opaque sheaths containing a blunt needle or toothpick that is pressed against the skin but is not inserted, though this would still put pressure on acupuncture points. Many academic medical centers and healthcare organizations, including the World Health Organization, continue to investigate and explore the efficacy of acupuncture. Side effects of acupuncture are usually mild if the technique is done correctly, but the following should be noted: Temporary worsening of symptoms may occur. Occasionally, needles are mistakenly left in place after acupuncture is completed; equipment counting, similar to that conducted after surgical procedures, makes this less likely. As with any medical treatment involving needles, some people may feel faint and need to lie down. Acupuncture may cause bruising or bleeding in people who have severe bleeding disorders or who take blood-thinning drugs. Doctors who diagnose and treat arthritis and other rheumatic disease include: General practitioners, . Rheumatologists, who specialize in arthritis and other diseases . Orthopaedists, who specialize in treatment and surgery for bone and joint diseases. Chiropractors, who focus treatment on the relationship between the body's structuremainly the spineand its functioning. Most children with juvenile arthritis need a combination of medication and other treatments to reach these goals. . If your childs medications or form of arthritis can affect the eyes, catching problems early can help keep them from becoming serious. Your doctor will talk to you to treat your arthritis, based upon the type you have. Possible treatments include: Medications such as: Pain relievers that are taken by mouth.
194	, treatment should be started as early as possible and may include: A brace to try to keep the spine straight, Physical therapy to keep scoliosis from getting worse, Surgery to join backbones together. Your child may feel badly about having scoliosis or be upset about the treatment. How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older. Congenital scoliosis is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries. Likewise, the more symptoms that develop, the greater the likelihood that scoliosis will worsen. Worsening scoliosis may eventually cause permanent problems, such as noticeable deformities or chronic pain. Severe scoliosis may even affect internal organsfor example, deforming and damaging the lungs. Sometimes scoliosis can worsen even if symptoms have not developed. In most children who have scoliosis, the curvature does not progress further but rather remains small. Scoliosis that causes symptoms, is worsening, or is severe may need to be treated. Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone, or spine. Scoliosis is most common , . Doctors use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to diagnose scoliosis. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Mild scoliosis usually has no symptoms. But sometimes children have: One shoulder higher higher than the other causing an uneven waist Mild to severe back pain Severe scoliosis can cause: Constant pain Difficulty breathing, to internal organs. Mild or more severe pain may eventually follow. Mild scoliosis may be discovered . Treatment depends on many things: The cause of scoliosis, Where the curve is in your spine, How big the curve is, If your body is still growing. Scoliosis treatment may also include: Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.
195	Arthritis is inflammation . A joint is the area where two bones meet. There are over 1 different types of arthritis. Psoriatic Arthritis can occur in people who have psoriasis (scaly red and white skin patches). It affects the skin, joints, and areas where tissues attach to bone. Reactive Arthritis is pain or swelling in a joint that is caused . You may also have red, swollen eyes and a swollen urinary tract. Rheumatoid arthritis happens when the bodys own defense system doesnt work properly. It affects joints and bones (often of the hands and feet), and may also affect internal organs and systems.
197	Many diseases can cause malabsorption. Most often, malabsorption involves problems absorbing certain sugars, fats, proteins, or vitamins. Problems or damage to the small intestine that may lead to problems absorbing important nutrients. These include: Celiac disease, Tropical sprue, Crohn disease, Whipple disease, Damage from radiation treatments, Overgrowth , Parasite or tapeworm infection, Surgery that removes all or part , Enzymes produced absorb fats and other nutrients. A decrease of these enzymes makes it harder to absorb fats and certain nutrients. Problems with the pancreas may be caused by: Cystic fibrosis Infections or swelling of the pancreas, Trauma to remove part of the pancreas. Some of the other causes of malabsorption include: AIDS and HIV Certain medicines (tetracycline, some antacids, some medicines used to treat obesity, colchicine, acarbose, phenytoin, cholestyramine), Gastrectomy and surgical treatments for obesity Cholestasis Chronic liver disease Cow's milk protein intolerance Soy milk protein intolerance. Some malabsorption diseases have specific treatments. For example, tropical sprue and Whipple disease are treated with antibiotics. You may need to take extra vitamins and nutrients. Mal means bad. So malabsorption means bad absorption. A problem somewhere in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract keeps you from absorbing one or more kinds of nutrients. Malabsorption can be caused by diseases, surgery on your intestines, or intestinal infections You'll usually lose weight and have diarrhea and smelly stool (poop) After a while, you may get vitamin deficiencies, which may give you a low blood count and feel make you feel sick Doctors often have to do stool and blood tests and sometimes look (endoscopy) Different causes of malabsorption need different treatments, but doctors usually try to adjust your diet to relieve your symptoms. Malabsorption involves problems with the body's ability to take in nutrients from food. Treatment depends on the cause and is aimed at relieving symptoms and ensuring the body receives enough nutrients. If the body is not able to absorb enough nutrients, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is tried. Your provider will select the right amount of calories and TPN solution. Sometimes, you can also eat and drink while getting nutrition from TPN.
202	The outcome is often good if you have surgery to repair the aneurysm before it ruptures. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm begins to tear or ruptures, it is a medical emergency. Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs . Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are aneurysms that occur . They may occur at any age, but are most common . Many people with an AAA have no symptoms, but some people have a pulsing sensation in the abdomen and/or pain in the back. If the aneurysm ruptures, it may cause deep, severe pain; nausea; vomiting; fast heart rate; clammy skin; and/or shock. About 20% of AAAs eventually rupture and are often fatal. The condition has multiple genetic and environmental risk factors , and may sometimes occur as part of an inherited syndrome . When more than one family member is affected, it may be considered " familial abdominal aortic aneurysm." Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and may include blood pressure medications, or surgery to repair the aneurysm. If you have bleeding inside your body from an aortic aneurysm, you will need surgery right away. If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms: Surgery is rarely done. Your provider may want to check the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound tests every 6 months. Most of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly. This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. The exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. Factors that can increase your risk of having this problem include: Smoking High blood pressure Male gender Genetic factors An abdominal aortic aneurysm is most often seen in males over age 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or tear. The aorta is the main blood vessel (artery) . An aneurysm is a bulge . An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge . Aneurysms may cause a pulsing feeling in your belly Aneurysms that are large or are growing need surgery to prevent them from bursting If the aneurysm bursts, blood flows out and you have severe pain and low blood pressure If the aneurysm bursts, you'll die if you don't have surgery Doctors often find an aneurysm during a regular exam or from an imaging test (such as an x-ray or CT scan) taken for another problem and found by accident You're more likely to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm if: You're a man You're between the ages of 50 and 80 Someone in your family had one You have high blood pressure You smoke.
203	Treatment for acute or chronic pancreatitis may includea hospital stay to treat dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids and, if you can swallow them, fluids by mouth pain medicine, and antibiotics if you have an infection in your pancreas a low-fat diet, or nutrition if you can't eatYour doctor may send you , depending on the type of pancreatitis that you have. Your doctor may remove damaged tissue from your pancreas. Doctors use ERCP to treat both acute and chronic pancreatitis. ERCP combines upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and x-rays to treat narrowing or blockage . Your gastroenterologist may use ERCP to remove gallstones blocking the bile or pancreatic ducts. Treatment for chronic pancreatitis may help relieve pain, improve how well the pancreas works, and manage complications. Your doctor may give you enzyme pills to help with digestion, or vitamins A, D, E, and K if you have malabsorption. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away with treatment. Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Inserting a tube to remove the contents of the stomach (nasogastric suctioning) may sometimes be done. The right diet is important for people with chronic pancreatitis to keep a healthy weight and get the correct nutrients. A nutritionist can help you create a diet that includes: Drinking plenty of liquids, Limiting fats, Eating small, frequent meals (this helps reduce digestive symptoms), Getting enough vitamins and calcium , Limiting caffeine. The health care provider may prescribe pancreatic enzymes. Avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages, even if your pancreatitis is mild. Other treatments may involve: Pain medicines or a surgical nerve block to relieve pain Taking insulin to control blood sugar (glucose) level Surgery may be performed if a blockage is found. In severe cases, a part of or the entire pancreas may be removed.
204	These people may benefit from taking modafinil, which is a mild stimulant used to treat daytime sleepiness in people with obstructive sleep apnea. Other drugs are also being tested for people with obstructive sleep apnea. Removable oral appliances, fitted by dentists, can help relieve obstructive sleep apnea (and snoring) in people with mild to moderate sleep apnea. It is most often helpful in people who have mild sleep apnea. The animation shows how the airway can collapse and block air flow to the lungs, causing sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea can affect anyone. Central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn't happen with central sleep apnea. Oxygen delivered by nasal prongs (not under pressure) may reduce episodes of apnea in people whose levels of blood oxygen become low while sleeping. Some people with central sleep apnea may benefit from CPAP. People with central apnea of the Cheyne-Stokes type have fewer episodes of apnea and a lower severity of heart failure with this treatment but do not survive longer. Acetazolamide can help people who have central sleep apnea caused by high altitude and possibly even people at sea level. To treat obstructive sleep apnea, your doctor may: Give you a CPAP machine to help you breathe while you sleep Give you a mouthpiece that helps keep your airway open during sleep Sometimes do surgery on the back of your mouth to remove and reshape tissue Surgically place a device to help keep your airway open A . CPAP works very well, but many people aren't able to sleep well . Apnea is a medical word for "not breathing." Sleep apnea is when your breathing slows or stops while you're sleeping and then restarts. This happens over and over each time you sleep, often many times an hour. You wake up partway when your breathing stops. However, it still breaks up a good night's sleep. People with sleep apnea usually snore loudly at night and are very tired during the day. Doctors usually do a sleep study if they suspect sleep apnea.
205	The causes for pain in many joints usually are different than those for pain in a single joint. Pain in many joints is usually caused by: Arthritis Arthritis is joint inflammation that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. The causes of the arthritis are different depending on whether the joints started hurting suddenly (acutely) or have been hurting (chronic).Sudden (acute) arthritis in more than one joint is most often caused by: Infection from a virus, The start of a joint disorder or a flare up of a long-term joint disorder (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Less common causes include: Lyme disease Gonorrhea Streptococcal infections Reactive arthritis Gout Chronic arthritis in more than one joint is caused , , lupus erythematosus Osteoarthritis, which is the most common cause in older adults, Autoimmune disorders Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (in children) .The most common disorders outside the joints that cause pain around the joints include: Fibromyalgia Polymyalgia rheumatica Bursitis or tendinitis. Follow your doctor's recommendation for treating the cause of the pain. For nonarthritis joint pain, both rest and exercise are important. Warm baths, massage, and stretching exercises should be used as often as possible. Aceteminophen (Tylenol) may help the soreness feel better. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may help relieve pain and swelling. Talk before giving aspirin or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen to children.
206	Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure. This means you likely do not have to stay overnight at a hospital. The surgery is performed by an ophthalmologist. Extracapsular extraction: The doctor uses a small tool to remove the cataract . This procedure uses a larger incision. Laser surgery: The doctor guides a machine that uses laser energy to make the incisions and soften the cataract. The rest of the surgery is much like phacoemulsification. Using the laser (scalpel) may speed recovery and be more accurate. The surgery lasts less than half an hour. , you may receive the following: A patch to wear over your eye until the follow-up exam, Eyedrops to prevent infection, treat inflammation, and help with healing You will need to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually have a follow-up exam with your doctor the next day. If you had stitches, you will need to make an appointment to have them removed. Tips for recovering after cataract surgery: Wear dark sunglasses outside after you remove the patch. Wash your hands well before and after using eyedrops and touching your eye. Try not to get soap and water in your eye when you are bathing or showering . Light activities are best as you recover. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving. Recovery takes about 2 weeks. If you need new glasses or contact lenses, you can usually have them fitted at that time. Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery. If a person has other eye problems, , the surgery may be more difficult or the outcome may not be as good.
207	Other characteristic facial features include a shortened distance (a short philtrum), a downturned mouth, a small chin (micrognathia), and poorly formed ears with small holes (pits) or flaps of skin (tags). Additionally, affected individuals may have asymmetrical facial features and an unusually small head (microcephaly). People with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome experience delayed growth and development. Slow growth begins before birth, and affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). They also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and underdeveloped muscles. Additional features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome include skin changes , skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis), dental problems including missing teeth, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and/or in the lip (cleft lip). Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome can also cause abnormalities of the eyes, heart, genitourinary tract, and brain. A condition called Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome has features that overlap with those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Researchers now recognize that these two conditions are actually part . Symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome often include profound intellectual disability. Children may also have epilepsy, a broad or beaked nose, scalp defects, drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and gaps or fissures (colobomas) of the iris, cleft palate, and delayed bone development. Boys may have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and a misplaced opening of the urethra (hypospadias). Some children have an immune deficiency, which means their body is less able to fight off infections. Many affected children die during infancy. The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) for people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) depends . The average life expectancy is unknown. Muscle weakness may increase the risk of having chest infections and ultimately may reduce the life expectancy. Many people, in the absence of severe heart defects, chest infections, and uncontrollable seizures , survive into adulthood.
210	The FDA does not have authority over dietary supplements in the same way it does prescription medicines. The Federal Government does not regularly test what is in dietary supplements, and companies are not required to share information on the safety of a dietary supplement with the FDA before they sell it. The FDA may also take these supplements off the market. The Federal Trade Commission looks into reports of ads that might misrepresent what dietary supplements do. A few private groups, such as the U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, ConsumerLab.com, and the Natural Products Association, have their own "seals of approval" for dietary supplements. However, some people don't get enough vitamins and minerals , and their doctors may recommend a supplement. Dietary supplements may provide nutrients that might be missing . Talk with your doctor before taking any supplements. Some supplements can change how medicines you may already be taking will work. If your doctor recommends a dietary supplement for you, make sure you're getting the brand recommended by the doctor and that you take it as directed. Do you wonder if you need a dietary supplement? Maybe you do, but usually not. Ask yourself why you think you might want to take a dietary supplement. Is a friend, a neighbor, or someone on a commercial suggesting you take one? Some ads seem to promise that these supplements will make you feel better, keep you from getting sick, or even help you live longer. If you are thinking about using dietary supplements:- Learn. Find out as much as you can about any dietary supplement you might take. Talk with your doctor, your pharmacist, or a registered dietitian. He or she needs to know if you decide to use a dietary supplement. Learn how medications can interact with dietary supplements. However, a few supplements (for example, fish oil, chondroitin, glucosamine, St. John's wort) are proven to be safe and useful additions to standard drugs. Did You Know... Manufacturers are not required to prove that dietary supplements are safe and effective. For some supplements, the only evidence suggesting effectiveness is reports about individual people or studies conducted in animals. Evidence is increasing rapidly as more and more clinical studies are being done.
211	The shingles vaccine is a safe and easy, one-time shot that may keep you from getting shingles. Most people age 60 and older should get vaccinated. You should get the shot even if you have already had shingles or don't remember having chickenpox. However, if you have a weak immune system or allergies to certain medicines, make sure to check with your doctor first. You can get the shingles vaccine at your doctor's office and at some pharmacies. At least 1 million people a year get shingles. Shingles vaccine A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2 . In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored . There are two shingles vaccines: a newer recombinant vaccine and an older, weakened live-virus vaccine. The recombinant vaccine is preferred and is recommended , regardless of whether they recall having had chickenpox or shingles and regardless of whether they have been vaccinated vaccine. The recombinant vaccine significantly reduces the chance of getting shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. Everyone who has had chickenpox has VZV in their body and is at risk for getting shingles. Right now, there is no way of knowing who will get the disease. The risk of getting shingles increases as you age. People may have a harder time fighting off infections as they get older. About half are . The chance of getting shingles becomes much greater by age 70. In fact, most adults live and never get shingles. But, , the virus will become active again. , it produces shingles. Having shingles doesn't mean you have any other underlying disease.
212	Symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear . Chronic infections occur in the skin, lungs, lymph nodes, mouth, nose, urinary tract, and intestines. Pockets of pus (abscesses) can develop . Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting . Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. People with this condition may also have areas of inflammation (granulomas) in various tissues that can result in damage to those tissues. The features of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear in childhood, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. Interferon gamma, Transfusions of granulocytes, Stem cell transplantation, Antibiotics, usually trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are given regularly and indefinitely to prevent infection. Antifungal drugs (such as itraconazole) are usually also given regularly to help prevent fungal infections. Interferon gamma (a drug that modifies the immune system), injected 3 times a week, can reduce the number and severity of infections. Stem cell transplantation has cured some people with chronic granulomatous disease. Close relatives who have a similar tissue and blood types are the best donors. If they are willing to donate, they can be tested to determine . Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that affects certain white blood cells . People with this condition have immune systems that do not function properly, leaving the body vulnerable . The features of this condition usually develop in infancy or early childhood; however, milder forms may be diagnosed . It is caused by changes ( mutations ) in any one of five different genes and is usually inherited . Treatment consists to treat and prevent infections. The only cure for the disease is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
213	Bell palsy is sudden weakness . It happens when a nerve in your face (called the facial nerve) swells and gets squeezed. Bell palsy affects only one side of your face. Most people with Bell palsy get better . But, it may take weeks or even months for the muscles to get stronger. Sometimes, medicines may be used, but it isn't known how much they help. Common medicines are: Corticosteroids, which may reduce swelling , Medicines such as valacyclovir to fight the virus that may be causing Bell palsy, Surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve (decompression surgery) has not been shown to benefit most people with Bell palsy. Bell's palsy is a form . This disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paralysis that often affects just one side and can cause significant facial distortion. Symptoms vary, but may include twitching, weakness, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. , many researchers believe that a virus may lead . Other medications used to treat Bell's palsy include acyclovir (to fight viral infections) and aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (to relieve pain). Physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture have also been used. Bell's palsy is a disorder of the nerve that controls movement . This nerve is called the facial orseventh cranial nerve. Damage to this nerve causes weakness or paralysis of these muscles. Most people who have Bell palsy recover completely, without treatment, in several months. Some people who have severe Bell palsy and can't move one side of their face at all may not recover fully. If you've had symptoms , doctors may give you medicine called a corticosteroid that can make full recovery even more likely. If you cannot close your eye all the way, your doctor may give you eye drops or a patch to protect your eye .
215	The effectiveness of Ritalin LA for long-term use, i.e., , has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.

Before starting RITALIN tell your or your child s doctor about all health conditions (or a family history of) including: heart problems, heart defects, high blood pressure mental problems including psychosis, mania, bipolar illness, or depression tics or Tourette s syndrome seizures or have had an abnormal brain wave test (EEG) Tell your doctor if you or your child is pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breast-feeding. Can RITALIN be taken with other medicines? Tell your doctor about all of the medicines that you or your child take including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. RITALIN and some medicines may interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Sometimes the doses of other medicines will need to be adjusted while taking RITALIN . RITALIN treatment may be stopped if a problem is found during these check-ups. If you or your child takes too much RITALIN or overdoses, call your doctor or poison control center right away, or get emergency treatment. What are possible side effects of RITALIN ? See What is the most important information I should know about RITALIN ? Ritalin should be initiated in small doses, . SR Tablets: Ritalin-SR tablets have a duration . Therefore, Ritalin-SR tablets may be used in place of Ritalin tablets when the 8-hour dosage of Ritalin-SR corresponds to the titrated 8-hour dosage of Ritalin. Ritalin-SR tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. If paradoxical aggravation occur, reduce dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. Ritalin should be periodically discontinued to assess the child s condition. Pharmacodynamics Ritalin is a mild central nervous system stimulant. The mode is not completely understood, but Ritalin presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence . Effects on QT Interval The effect of Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of Ritalin) was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses . No gender differences were observed for Ritalin plasma concentration .
217	The condition causing numbness is corrected or treated when possible.

The pattern of body parts affected by numbness often indicates which part of the nerve pathway is malfunctioning: Part of a limb: Peripheral nerve or sometimes spinal nerve root malfunction Arm and leg on the same side of the body: Brain malfunction Both sides of the body below a specific level of the body: Spinal cord malfunction, as occurs in transverse myelitis (which causes inflammation across the entire width of the spinal cord), Both sides, mainly in the hands and feet: Simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body (a polyneuropathy), Then doctors ask about the person's other symptoms and medical history. Doctors also do a physical examination. suggests a cause and the tests that may need to be done (see table Some Causes and Features of Numbness).Doctors ask the person to describe the numbness. Then doctors may ask specific questions: When numbness began How quickly it began Whether the person also has other symptoms , weakness or paralysis, loss , retention , difficulty swallowing, or deterioration of mental function Whether any event, such as pressure on a limb, an injury, sleeping , or an infection, triggered the symptoms Knowing how quickly numbness and other symptoms began helps doctors determine the type of disorder. Doctors also ask whether the person has had a disorder that can cause numbness, particularly diabetes, chronic kidney disease, infections (such as HIV infection or Lyme disease), a stroke, or arthritis.

219	, you may want to talk with your doctor about other ways to help manage incontinence:- Medicines can help the bladder empty more fully during urination. Other drugs tighten muscles and can lessen leakage. Some women find that using an estrogen vaginal cream may help relieve stress or urge incontinence. A low dose of estrogen cream is applied directly . A doctor may inject a substance that thickens the area around the urethra to help close the bladder opening. A pessary, a stiff ring inserted into the vagina, may help prevent leaking if you have a prolapsed bladder or vagina. Nerve stimulation, which sends mild electric current to the nerves around the bladder that help control urination, may be another option. Surgery can sometimes improve or cure incontinence if it's caused . Even after treatment, some people still leak urine from time to time. Bladder control training may help you get better control of your bladder. Making these muscles stronger helps you hold urine in your bladder longer. Learn more and how to do them. Biofeedback uses sensors to make you aware . This may help you regain control . Biofeedback can be helpful when learning pelvic muscle exercises. Timed voiding may help you control your bladder. In timed voiding, you urinate on a set schedule, for example, every hour. You can slowly extend the time between bathroom trips. When timed voiding is combined , you may find it easier to control urge and overflow incontinence. Lifestyle changes may help with incontinence. Losing weight, quitting smoking, saying no to alcohol, drinking less caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and many sodas), preventing constipation and avoiding lifting heavy objects may help with incontinence. Choosing water and limiting drinks before bedtime may also help.

Speech therapy helps stroke patients relearn language and speaking skills, or learn other forms of communication. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who have no problems , but have problems understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech. People cannot articulate words normally because part of the nervous system that controls muscles used in speech is damaged. Rehabilitation goals depend . If the cause is a stroke, a head injury, or brain surgery, the goal is to restore and preserve speech. If dysarthria is mild, repetition may enable people to relearn to use facial muscles and the tongue for correct pronunciation. If dysarthria is severe, people may be taught to use a letter or picture board or an electronic communication device (print or screen).If dysarthria is caused by a progressive disorder of the nervous system, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig disease) or multiple sclerosis, the goal of therapy is to maintain speech function . People are taught exercises that increase control and are taught to speak more slowly and use shorter phrases.
227	Live shingles vaccine can provide protection . Another type of shingles vaccine, recombinant shingles vaccine, is the preferred vaccine.  However, live shingles vaccine may be used in some circumstances (for example if a person is allergic to recombinant shingles vaccine or prefers live shingles vaccine, or if recombinant shingles vaccine is not available).

Occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head. Typically, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards. Some individuals will also experience pain . Their scalp may also be tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light. The location of pain is related . The pain is caused to the nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves , compression of the nerve as it leaves the spine due to osteoarthritis, or tumors or other types . Localized inflammation or infection, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head are also associated with occipital neuralgia. In many cases, however, no cause can be found. A positive response (relief from pain) will confirm the diagnosis.

231	Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your peripheral nervous system (PNS). The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. Without treatment, most people with Guillain-Barr syndrome improve slowly over several months. After initial improvement, 3 to 10% of people with Guillain-Barr syndrome develop chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. In Guillain-Barr syndrome, the immune response damages peripheral nerves, which are the nerves that connect the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) . Guillain-Barr syndrome can affect the neurons that control muscle movement (motor neurons); the neurons that transmit sensory signals (sensory neurons); or both. , affected individuals can lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs and can have abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia).Miller Fisher syndrome, another type of Guillain-Barr syndrome, involves cranial nerves, . Miller Fisher syndrome is characterized by three features: weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eyes (ophthalmoplegia), problems (ataxia), and areflexia. People with this condition can have other signs and symptoms common in Guillain-Barr syndrome, such as muscle weakness. Guillain-Barr syndrome occurs . Most people who have Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) regain muscle strength . Some people may have a slower recovery , and they may be . About 30% of people who had GBS continue to have muscle weakness years . In rare cases, people have passed away . Causes of death may include acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, pulmonary emboli, and unexplained cardiac arrest. Some people with GBS may relapse . The risk of relapse appears to be higher in people who have had a later onset of treatment, a longer-lasting disease, and other medical problems occurring . , suddenly relying on family members and medical professionals to help with tasks required for daily living can be devastating. In some cases, people with GBS may suffer . It is important for people with GBS and their family members to tell their doctor , especially if the depression is long-lasting and does not improve as the physical symptoms of GBS improve. Unfortunately, there is no cure for Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS). Both of these therapies can help prevent the immune system from continuing to attack the peripheral nervous system. In some cases, corticosteroids have been used to try to alleviate symptoms of GBS. However, it has not been proven that steroids can help speed recovery. People who have GBS may be admitted to the hospital for treatment and to reduce the risk of complications. In some cases, other treatments may be necessary to prevent complications of GBS including pain medications and heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots. Some people with GBS may require help breathing with a ventilator. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended to help people fully recover from GBS.

234	The electrodes send small amounts of electricity and thus help relieve symptoms. Deep brain stimulation is sometimes done when drugs cannot control a severe, disabling tremor. Sometimes essential tremors or tremors require such treatment. These treatments are available only at special centers. What are the treatments for tremor?. There is no cure for most forms of tremor, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. Tremor caused may get better or go away when you treat that condition. If your tremor is caused , stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away. Treatments for tremor where the cause is not found include Medicines. Primary orthostatic tremor (POT) is a rare, progressive that causes unsteadiness when standing still, due to a rapid affecting the legs and trunk. The tremor is sometimes described as having shaky legs, and it improves or disappears when walking, sitting, or lying down. This may cause people with POT to attempt to sit again or walk immediately after standing, for fear of falling. People with POT may also experience tiredness, physical exhaustion, muscle stiffness or weakness, and/or pain. Symptoms tend to gradually worsen over time and may lead . The diagnosis of POT relies on a clinical exam as well as a specialized test called a surface electromyogram (EMG), which measures electrical activity in the muscles. The cause of POT is not completely understood, but the disorder is thought to involve dysfunction to regulate nerve signals that control muscle activity. Some researchers believe that POT is a type of . Treatment usually involves medications used to control seizures (anticonvulsants) . More than one therapy may be tried before finding one that helps. POT does not appear to alter life expectancy. However, quality of life may be severely impaired due to physical symptoms, fear of falling, and uncertainty .

If your tremor happens when you reach for things, you may: Work with a therapist to use weights on your wrists to steady the tremor Hold your arm steady while reaching If your tremor happens when you walk, strapping a weight to your ankle may help steady your leg. Eliminating or minimizing the trigger may lessen the tremor. People with a physiologic tremor and anxiety may benefit from taking a low dose of a benzodiazepine (a sedative), such as lorazepam. If a physiologic tremor is worsened by taking prescribed drugs that are necessary or , propranolol (a beta-blocker) may help.
235	High cholesterol can also be caused by: Eating a lot of foods high in fat and cholesterol Having diabetes Not being active Drinking too much alcohol Taking certain medicines Treatment includes: Eating a healthy diet more fruits and vegetables Losing weight (if you are overweight) Exercising You may also need medicine to lower your cholesterol. You want your HDL cholesterol to be high. Exercise can help raise it. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol Bile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides.. PCSK9 inhibitors, which block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Fibrates, which lower triglycerides. They may also raise HDL (good) cholesterol. If you take them with statins, they may increase the risk of muscle problems.

238	People with this type of memory loss occasionally forget things, such as where they left their car keys. But for them, , the ability to do daily activities or to think is not impaired. This type of memory loss is not a sign of dementia or early Alzheimer disease. Mild cognitive impairment. can cause a type of memory loss (called pseudodementia) that resembles memory loss due to dementia. Thus, determining whether dementia or depression is the cause of memory loss can be difficult. However, people with memory loss due to depression, , are aware of their memory loss and complain about it. The most common cause of memory loss is: Getting olderminor changes in memory can be normal as you age. Memory loss that is more severe than expected for a person 's age , particularly difficulty remembering recent events and conversations ( short-term memory loss ) Memory loss and fear of dementia are common sources . Usually, memory loss results from normal age-related changes in the brain, which slow mental functions slightly but do not significantly impair them. Memory loss due to dementia usually interferes with the ability to do daily activities and becomes progressively worse. People who are aware of memory loss may not have dementia. Memory loss is the inability to remember things as well as you used to. Mild memory loss can be a normal part of aging. Memory loss may be a warning sign , . Your family members may notice your memory loss before you do. Signs of more serious memory loss include forgetting or having problems doing activities you've done many times before. Using lists, calendars, and memory aids can help you cope with memory loss. In delirium, memory is affected, but memory loss is not the most noticeable symptom. Doctors can usually determine whether the cause is age-related changes, mild cognitive impairment, or early dementia based on the type of memory loss and the symptoms that accompany it. These tests must be given by a trained, licensed psychologist or psychiatrist with expertise in memory loss.
239	Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition . This condition occurs worldwide, but it is much more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths).
