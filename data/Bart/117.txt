Pandemic Influenza outbreaks have been predictably unpredictable in the years since 1918 but always global. One million people around the world died in a 1957 outbreak which started in China but spread globally. The 2009 Swine flu A(H1N1) pandemic, started in Mexico and spread to over 214 countries and overseas territories or communities. Researchers are always on the lookout, though, because the next outbreak could be far worse. WHO and partners are developing a Global Influenza Strategy to be launched in 2018. This will include improved influenza modelling and forecasting, along with the development of new vaccines, including a possible universal influenza vaccine. WHO is working closely with Ministries of Health, regional and national influenza research and surveillance centres, and other stakeholders to develop a multi-layered approach to preparing for and responding to both seasonal flu outbreaks and pandemics.
