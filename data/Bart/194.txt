How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. The more severe the curve, the greater the likelihood of it worsening. Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early teens. Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips. WorseningScoliosis may eventually cause permanent problems, such as noticeable deformities or chronic pain. It can also affect internal organsfor example, deforming and damaging the lungs. Most people with idiopathic scoliotic do not need treatment. Congenital scolia is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries. The earlier treatment is begun, the better the chance of preventing a severe deformity. Treatment depends on your age, how much more you're likely to grow, and how much curving there is. If your body is still growing, treatment depends on whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mildscoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curves are getting worse. They may have another serious disorder such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, so their goals are much different. Often, the goal of surgery is simply to allow a child to be able to sit upright in a wheelchair. Doctors use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to diagnose scliosis. Mild scoliosia usually causes no symptoms. Sometimes the back becomes sore or stiff after the child sits or stands for a long period of time.
