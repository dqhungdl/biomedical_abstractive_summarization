If a person has COVID-19, they may be contagious for a longer period of time than if they had flu. For adults who never develop symptoms, isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Some adults with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset. Infants and people with weakened immune systems can be infectious for even longer. It?s possible for people to spread the virus for about 2 days before experiencing signs or symptoms. If someone is asymptomatic or their symptoms go away, itâ€™s possible to remain contagious for at least 10 days. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the strategy outlined in Part 1, above. Viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCr or antigen)*** and quarantine is not recommended if another exposure occurs or might have occurred within 90 days after date of symptom onset from the initial Sars- cov-2 infection.
