Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a type of chronic pain that affects your face. It causes extreme, sudden burning or shock-like pain. The pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown. There is no single test to diagnose TN, and it can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain. Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary techniques. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age. It may be part of the normal aging process but it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves. Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening. But the longer you have it, the less often it goes away. TN usually affects people over 50, especially women. When TN affects people younger than 40, it is often due to MS or a tumor. TN may be caused by: Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering myelin of the nerves Pressure on the nerve from a swollen blood vessel or tumor Injury to the nerve such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery
