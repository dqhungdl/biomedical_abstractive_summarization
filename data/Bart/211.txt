Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. About half of all shingles cases are in adults age 60 or older. The chance of getting singles becomes much greater by age 70. People may have a harder time fighting off infections as they get older. It can cause burning, shooting pain, tingling, and/or itching, as well as a rash and blisters. For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. The risk of getting shedles increases as you age. The recombinant vaccine is preferred and is recommended for healthy people aged 50 or over. It is given in two doses, injected into a muscle. The doses are given 2 to 6 months apart and at least 2 months after the older (weakened live-virus) vaccine for people who have had that vaccine. Some people should not get shsles vaccine or should wait. A person should not receive the vaccine if he or she: - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the vaccine. If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. The vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems, such as signs of a very high fever, or behavior changes. For people with a weak immune system or allergies to certain medicines, make sure to check with your doctor first. It's recommended that people get the vaccine at your doctor's office and at some pharmacies.
