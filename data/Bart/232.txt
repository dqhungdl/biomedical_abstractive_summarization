Urinary retention is when: You can't urinate (pee) at all or only a little You can urinate but there's still urine in your bladder after you're done With urinary retention: You may also leak urine and urinate without meaning to (urinary incontinence) Doctors may use a catheter (thin flexible tube) to empty your bladder. Certain medicines that can cause urinary retention are stopped whenever possible. Surgery is needed to direct urine from the bladder away from the urethra and out of the body. Men who have an enlarged prostate may need prostate surgery or drugs to shrink the prostate (for example, finasteride or dutasteride) or drugs that relax the muscles at the neck of the bladder. People who have nerve problems that interfere with bladder contractions or function may need to use aCatheter themselves periodically or have a Catheter permanently placed. If people cannot urinate at all, doctors immediately insert a thin rubber tube into the bladder to remove the retained urine and provide relief. The cause of urinary retention is treated.
