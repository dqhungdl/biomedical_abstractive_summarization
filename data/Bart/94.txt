Many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. The choice of the appropriate treatment is based on the severity of the symptoms, the extent to which they affect lifestyle, and the presence of other medical conditions. For mild symptoms: Urinate when you first get the urge, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, and avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner. Try NOT to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms. Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime. Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed, and more research is needed.

Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH. The drugs Finasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate.
