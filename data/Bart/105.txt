Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills - are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can. cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or. hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a people has dementia.
