Most girls go through puberty somewhere between being 8 to 15 years old. Puberty is a wide age range when puberty starts. Problems with puberty usually involve hormones. There are many different hormone problems that result in too few hormones so that puberty is delayed or doesn't start at all. Some kids in 7th grade still look like young children and others look really grown up.
