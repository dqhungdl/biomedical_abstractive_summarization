Usher syndrome is an inherited disease that causes serious hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa. There are three types of Usher syndrome: people with type I are deaf from birth and have severe balance problems from a young age. People with type III are born with normal hearing and near-normal balance but develop vision problems and then hearing loss. If both parents are carriers of a mutated gene for Usher Syndrome, they will have a one-in-four chance of having a child with the disorder with each¬†birth. If a child is diagnosed with type 1 Usher. syndrome early on, before he or she loses the ability to see, that child is. more likely to benefit from the full spectrum of intervention strategies. that can help him or her participate more fully in life. The earlier that parents know if their child has Usher syndrom, the sooner that child can begin special educational training programs to manage the loss of hearing and. vision.
