Pelvic muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises) work the muscles that you use to stop urinating. Biofeedback can be helpful when learning pelvic muscle exercises. Timed voiding may help you control your bladder. In timed voiding, you urinate on a set schedule, for example, every hour. Lifestyle changes may help with incontinence. Losing weight, quitting smoking, drinking less caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and many sodas), preventing constipation and avoiding lifting heavy objects may help. Choosing water instead of other drinks and limiting drinks before bedtime may also help. Read about this topic in Spanish. Lea sobre este tema en espanol.
