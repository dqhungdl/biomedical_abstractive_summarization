Mal means bad. A problem somewhere in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract keeps you from absorbing one or more kinds of nutrients. Malabsorption can be caused by diseases, surgery on your intestines, or intestinal infections. Different causes of malabsorption need different treatments, but doctors usually try to adjust your diet to relieve your symptoms. A high-calorie diet may be tried. Medicines to slow down the normal movement of the intestine can be tried to allow food to remain in the intestine longer. If the body is not able to absorb enough nutrients, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is tried. It will help you or your child get nutrition from a special formula through a vein in the body. It should supply: Key vitamins and minerals, such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12. Enough carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. If needed, injections of some vitamins and Minerals or special growth factors will be given. Those with damage to the pancreas may need to take pancreatic enzymes. Your provider will prescribe these if necessary. If you have a vitamin deficiency, you'll take extra vitamins. After a while, you may get vitamin deficiencies, which may give you a low blood count and feel make you feel sick. Doctors often have to do stool and blood tests and sometimes look in your stomach and intestines with a flexible scope (endoscopy) Sometimes, you can also eat and drink while getting nutrition from TPN. For example, tropical sprue and Whipple disease are treated with antibiotics. In general, if you have trouble with only certain foods, doctors will have you avoid them.
