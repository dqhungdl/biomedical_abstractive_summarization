FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent are licensed only for persons aged 65 years and older. One other flu vaccine is licensed specifically for people 65 and over. The high-dose flu vaccine contains four times the amount of antigen as the standard-dose inactivated flu vaccine. It has been associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination and better effectiveness than the regular dose flu vaccine in older people in a two-season randomized trial. It is not recommended to use all flu vaccines at the same time.
