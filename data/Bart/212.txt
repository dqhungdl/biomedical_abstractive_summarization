Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that affects certain white blood cells. People with this condition have immune systems that do not function properly, leaving the body vulnerable to chronic inflammation and frequent bacterial and fungal infections. The features of this condition usually develop in infancy or early childhood; however, milder forms may be diagnosed in the teen years or even in adulthood. The only cure for the disease is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Antibiotics and antifungal drugs to prevent and treat infections are usually also given regularly to help prevent infections. Interferon gamma (a drug that modifies the immune system), injected 3 times a week, can reduce the number and severity of infections. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that includes some phagagocytes. Stem cell transplants have cured some people with chronic granulOMatous. disease. The disease is caused by changes ( mutations ) in any one of five different genes. It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner.[3] Treatment consists of continuous therapy with antibiotic and anti-fungal medications to treat and prevent infections, as well as regular check-ups to check for new infections and to monitor the progress of existing ones. It can take up to four years for a person to recover from a chronic bacterial or fungal infection, but with treatment, most affected individuals live into mid- to late adulthood. Some people with the disease may develop fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. The skin, lungs, lymph nodes, mouth, nose, urinary tract, and intestines are also common areas of infection.
