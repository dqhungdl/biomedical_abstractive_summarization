Damage stops progressing within 8 weeks. Without treatment, most people with Guillain-Barr syndrome improve slowly over several months. With early treatment, people can improve very quicklyin days or weeks. About 30% of people who had GBS continue to have muscle weakness years after the first symptoms of GBS. Some people with GBS may relapse after an original improvement of symptoms. The risk of relapse appears to be higher in people who have had a later onset of treatment, a longer-lasting disease, and other medical problems occurring at the same time. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended to help people fully recover from GBS, but there is no cure for the syndrome. The symptoms of the syndrome can be improved with treatments including plasma exchange therapy and immunoglobulin therapy. Both of these therapies can help prevent the immune system from continuing to attack the peripheral nervous system. In some cases, corticosteroids have been used to try to alleviate symptoms ofGBS.
