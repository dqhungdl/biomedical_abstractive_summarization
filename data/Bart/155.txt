Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease characterized by deterioration or breakdown of the macula, which is responsible for sharp, central vision. The wet form of AMD is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. Risk factors for AMD are: Family history of AMD Being White Cigarette smoking High-fat diet Being a woman are all risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving. There are two types of AMD: wet and dry. Dry AMD typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other. In severe cases, it can lead to blindness. Certain vitamins may help slow vision loss from AMD. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.
