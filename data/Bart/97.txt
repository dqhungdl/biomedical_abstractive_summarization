Sensorineural deafness is a type of hearing loss. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or the brain. Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. Cochlear Implant is a small electronic device that the surgeon places under the skin and behind the ear. The device picks up sounds, changes them to electrical signals, and sends them past the non-working part of the inner ears and on to thebrain. It lets many people communicate orally in person and over the telephone, and perceive sounds in the environment. Treating hearing loss early can allow many infants to develop normal language skills without delay. In infants born with hearing loss, treatments should start as early as age 6 months. Over 30 states in the United States require newborn hearing screenings. Treatment may include: Speech therapy Learning sign language Cochlear implant (for those with profound sensorineural hearing loss) Medicines for infections Ear tubes for repeated ear infections Surgery to correct structural problems Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. This may be because: The 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly. Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum, often from scuba diving Skull fractures. Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones The eardrums are not vibrating in response to sound. Some hearing aids can be plugged into televisions or stereos to help you hear better.
