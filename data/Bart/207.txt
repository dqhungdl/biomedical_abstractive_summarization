Symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome often include profound intellectual disability. Children may also have epilepsy, a broad or beaked nose, scalp defects, drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and gaps or fissures (colobomas) of the iris. Motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are significantly delayed. Most affected children also have seizures, which may be resistant to treatment. Seizures tend to disappear with age. The long-term outlook depends on the specific features present and the severity of those features. The average life expectancy is unknown. Many people, in the absence of severe heart defects, chest infections, and uncontrollable seizures, survive into adulthood. The condition can also cause abnormalities of the eyes, heart, genitourinary tract, and brain. A condition called Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome has features that overlap with those ofWolf-Hirshhorn syndrome. Researchers now recognize that these two conditions are actually part of a single syndrome with variable signs and symptoms. Many affected children die during infancy. Many children have an immune deficiency, which means their body is less able to fight off infections. Muscle weakness may increase the risk of having chest infections and ultimately may reduce the life expectancy.
