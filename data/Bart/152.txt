Cri du chat syndrome is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. About 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. An infant with this syndrome may have a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. Webbed fingers and toes (syndactyly) and heart defects are common. There are significant limitations in mental and physical development. Many children with the syndrome survive to adulthood but have substantial disabilities. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child. The syndrome is rare. Most cases of cri duchat syndrome are not inherited. The symptoms of the syndrome include a characteristic high-pitched, mewing cry that sounds like a kitten crying. The cry may be heard immediately after birth, lasts several weeks, and then disappears.
