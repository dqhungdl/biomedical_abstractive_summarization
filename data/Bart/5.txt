Coughing is important because it helps clear your airways of irritants, such as smoke and mucus. Coughing also helps prevent infections. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Medications used to treat chronic cough may include: Antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. If a bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial infection is causing your chronic cough, your doctor may prescribe medications to address the infection. If you're taking an ACE inhibitor medication, your doctors may switch you to another medicine that doesn't have cough as a side effect. Some people need surgery to resolve the problem of acid reflux. For example, antibiotics may be given for pneumonia. For asthma-related cough, Corticosteroid and bronchodilators can reduce inflammation and open up the airways. Inhaled asthma drugs are the most effective treatments.
