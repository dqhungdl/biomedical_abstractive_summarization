Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes vision loss. It usually happens when pressure from extra fluid within your eyeball damages the nerve in your eye (optic nerve) Vision loss usually happens slowly, so you may not notice it right away. It can cause lasting vision loss and blindness if not treated. Special eye drops (prescribed by your doctor) can lower the pressure in your eyes. Get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years to detect glaucomA early and help prevent vision loss if you're at risk for the disease. There is no cure for glau coma, but there are treatments that may save remaining vision. The risk is much greater for people over 60, so get an eye exam as soon as possible to be sure you don't have the disease, even if you have no symptoms yet. If you have the most common type of glauCOMa, get your eyes checked every 1-2 years.
