The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. Sinus headache is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. The pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or anEar infection. An earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain in one or both ears. It may last a short time or be ongoing. Other causes may include: Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in theEar. Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the Ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the Eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporom andibular Joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection Ear pain is more common in children.
