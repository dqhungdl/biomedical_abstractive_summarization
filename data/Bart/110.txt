According to many investigators, acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for a disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease but usually will not show symptoms. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. It is considered autosomal dominant, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
