Acupuncture may cause bruising or bleeding in people who have severe bleeding disorders or who take blood-thinning drugs. Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. If your childs doctor feels the approach has value and is not harmful, you can incorporate it into the treatment plan. DMARDs slow the progression of juvenile arthritis, but because they may take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they often are taken with an NSAID. The placebo for acupuncture may involve using opaque sheaths containing a blunt needle or toothpick that is pressed against the skin but is not inserted, though this would still put pressure on acupuncture points. All children with juvenile arthritis need to have regular exams by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to detect eye inflammation. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. The World Health Organization continues to investigate and explore the efficacy of acupuncture and other forms of alternative treatment for juvenile arthritis.
