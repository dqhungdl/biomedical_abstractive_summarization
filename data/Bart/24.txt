Primary familial brain calcification is caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most commonly mutated gene is called SLC20A2, and accounts for an estimated 40 percent of cases. Tests that might be done includes biochemical analysis of blood and urine, as well as analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known. Medications can be used to treat symptoms associated with this condition, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence. Off label prescription of biphosphanates have been reported in few patients. The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging. A family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (a person must inherit one copy of the altered gene from one parent to have the condition) can help confirm the diagnosis. The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. For individuals in who a diagnosis ofPFBC is being considered, other causes should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases.
