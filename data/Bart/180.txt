A doctor usually suspects hemorrhagic colitis when a person has bloody diarrhea. To make the diagnosis, a doctor has stool specimens tested for strains of E. coli or the toxins they produce. Other tests, such as sigmoidoscopy, may be done if a doctor suspects that other diseases may be cause of colitis. Ulcerative colitis can usually be controlled with medicines. A doctor may suspect ischemic colitis on the basis of pain and bleeding, especially in a person older than 60. It is important for doctors to distinguish acute mesia colitis from acute meschemic ischemia, a more dangerous condition in which part of the intestine is completely and irreversibly blocked. People with ulceratives colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. The disease affects the entire colon and affects the liver, especially if it is ongoing for at least 8 years. People who receive ongoing treatment and remain in remission may reduce their chances of developing colon cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) The NIH recommends colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years for people who have the disease in one-third or more of their colon or who have had it for 8 years or more.
