The outlook for people with transverse myelitis varies. Most recovery occurs within 3 months after the condition occurs. Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide. The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition. People with an underlying cause, such as MS, may be more likely to develop the spinal cord side of the condition in the future. There is no effective cure for transverseMyelitis, but there is a treatment option for the condition that may improve symptoms in some cases. For some, healing may take months to years. Recovery can take up to 2 or 3 years. About a third of people recover completely with moderate disabilities. Those who have poor chance of recovery are people whose symptoms do not improve within the first 6 months. It may only recur once in most people, but it may recur in some people once in two or three years.
