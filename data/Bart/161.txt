Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL) In MCL, there are cancerous B-cells within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone. MCL accounts for 6% of all NHL's and is mostly found in males during their early 60s. More than one half of people with BL can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may cure many types of high-grade lymphomas. In the case of advanced stage lymphoma, chemotherapy with immuno-chemotherapy should be offered (rituximab combined with CHOP). In cases of chemosensitive relapse, treatment can be intensified. Follicular lymphoma is located primarily in the lymph nodes, but can also involve the spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and Waldeyer's ring. Symptoms appear at an advanced stage of the disease and can include fever, night sweats and weight loss. At diagnosis, patients usually present with adenopathy and, in 50% of cases, splenomegaly. However, the majority of people treated with aggressive therapy achieve long-term remission.[5] In general, children with BL have better survival rates than adults with BL. The prognosis in children correlates with the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis. The outlook is poor for both children and adults if BL returns after improvement (relapses) or does not go into remission as a result of the first cycle of chemotherapy.[9][2] MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed. The median age at diagnosis is 60-65 years.
