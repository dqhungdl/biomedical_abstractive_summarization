Sleep apnea is when your breathing slows or stops for a short time while you're sleeping and then restarts. Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A CPAP machine pushes air into your throat through a mask. If you're not treated, you have an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease. Stop smoking, drink alcohol, or take drugs that cause drowsiness before bed. Sleeping on the side or elevating the head of the bed can help reduce snoring. Some people may benefit from taking modafinil, which is a mild stimulant used to treat daytime sleepiness. Acetazolamide can help people with central apnea caused by high altitude and possibly even people at sea level. Removable oral appliances, fitted by dentists, can help relieve obstructive sleepApnea (and snoring) in people with mild to moderate sleep apneas. Most appliances separate the jaws and push the lower jaw forward so the tongue move backward to the throat. Oxygen delivered by nasal prongs (not under pressure) may reduce episodes of apnea in people whose levels of blood oxygen become low while sleeping.
