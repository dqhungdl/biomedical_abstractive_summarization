Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition in which a female does not have the usual pair of two X chromosomes. This condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 newborn girls worldwide, but it is much more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths) In most cases, women with Turner syndrome are infertile.
