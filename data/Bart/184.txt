Gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) insertion is done in part using a procedure called endoscopy. This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end. Stitches are special threads that are sewn through the skin at an injury site to bring a wound together. Care for your stitches and wound as follows: Keep the area clean and dry for the first 24 to 48 hours after stitches have been placed. If there was a bandage over the stitches, replace it with a new clean bandage and antibiotic treatment, if instructed to do so. Your provider should also tell you when you need to have a wound checked and the stitches removed. If not, contact your provider for an appointment.
