Stool that comes from your ileostomy is thin or thick liquid, or it may be pasty. Foods you eat, medicines you take, and other things may change how thick or thin your stool is. You will need to empty the pouch 5 to 8 times a day. Some foods will loosen your stools and can increase output after you eat them. Call your provider if: Your stoma is swelling and is more than a half inch (1 centimeter) larger than normal You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad. You have any signs of being dehydrated (there is not enough water in your body). Some foods that may block your stoma are raw pineapple, nuts and seeds, celery, popcorn, corn, dried fruits (such as raisins), mushrooms, chunky relishes, coconut, and some Chinese vegetables. Some signs of blockage are sudden cramping in your belly, a swollen stoma, nausea (with or without vomiting), and sudden increase of very watery output. Try to eat foods that have potassium and sodium every day to keep your potassium and Sodium levels from getting too low.
