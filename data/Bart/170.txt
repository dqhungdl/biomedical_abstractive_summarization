Angelman syndrome is caused by the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the U BE3A gene. Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the gene. Most cases occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In a small percentage of cases, the disorder results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal. Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood. Children with Angelman Syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. With age, people with the condition become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Anticonvulsant medicines help control seizures. Behavior therapy helps manage hyperactivity, sleep problems, and development problems. Occupational and speech therapy manage speech problems and teach living skills. Physical therapy helps with walking and movement problems.
