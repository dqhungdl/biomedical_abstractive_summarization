There is no cure for most forms of tremor, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. Primary orthostatic tremor (POT) is a rare, progressive that causes unsteadiness when standing still, due to a rapid affecting the legs and trunk. Deep brain stimulation is sometimes done when drugs cannot control a severe, disabling tremor. Physical, speech-language, and occupational therapy may help to control tremor and deal with the daily challenges caused by the treMor. If your tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away. If you find that caffeine and other stimulants trigger your tremors, it may be helpful to cut them from your diet. Work with a therapist to use weights on your wrists to hold your arm steady while reaching for things, or strapping a weight to your ankle when you walk, may help. For certain types, having a family history of getting tremor may raise your risk of getting it. These treatments are only available at special centers at certain centers. Such centers are only used when a drug therapy has been tried and has been effective and has not been effective at other times. For those with a history of having a tremor that is not mild, you may not need treatment if you need treatment for it when it is mild, but you may need it if it happens when you need to reach for things like a fork or a glass at mealtime. For some people, the only treatment that is effective is Botox injections in the leg muscles. For others, there is no treatment for essential tremors or tremors due to Parkinson disease or another disorder such as gabapentin or levodopa (levodopa or pramipexole) In some cases, treatment may include medications used for Parkinsons disease and/or botulinum toxin (Botox) injections. For people with Parkinson's disease, Botox may be used to help control tremors and improve quality of life for people with the disease.
