Most people recover completely from a simple elbow sprain in about 4 weeks. Crush injuries most often need to be evaluated in a hospital emergency department. If there is suspicion of a head, neck, or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement to only the crushed area. You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or local hospital for further advice. You may need to wear a sling, splint, or cast for about 2 to 3 weeks while your elbow heals. Depending on how badly it is sprained, you might need to work with a physical therapist who will show you stretching and strengthening exercises. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Cold from the ice can damage your skin.
