Many older people have some degree of hypothyroidism. Typical symptoms, such as weight gain, muscle cramps, tingling of the hands, and the inability to tolerate cold, are less common among older people. Iodine is an essential mineral for the thyroid. People with autoimmune thyroid disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Women need more iodine when they are pregnantabout 250 micrograms a day because the baby gets iodine from the mothers diet. In the United States, about 7 percent of pregnant women may not get enough iodine in their diet or through prenatal vitamins. Choosing iodized salt salt supplemented with iodine over plain salt and prenatal vitamins containing iodine will ensure this need is met. It's important to talk to your doctor about medicines that interfere with absorbing thyroid hormone. Such medicines include iron, calcium, and some antacids. A screening test, in which blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone are measured, is important. The test should be done at age 65 even if people have no symptoms ofhypothyroidistism. After you start the pills, your doctor will gradually adjust the dose based on your TSH level. The treatment is to gradually increase the amount of thyroid hormone you are taking.
