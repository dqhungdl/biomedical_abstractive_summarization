If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor may suggest waiting at least 1 to 2 weeks between each surgery. Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery. If a person has other eye problems, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, the surgery may be more difficult or the outcome may not be as good. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving. Wearing dark sunglasses outside after you remove the patch is a good way to protect your eye from the sun. Try not to get soap and water in your eye when you are bathing or showering for the first few days. Light activities are best as you recover. If you need new glasses or contact lenses, you can usually have them fitted at that time. The lens is removed in one of the following ways: Phacoemulsification, Extracapsular extraction, Laser surgery or intraocular lens.
