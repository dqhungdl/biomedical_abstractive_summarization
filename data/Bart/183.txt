 Bartholin abscess is the buildup of pus that forms a lump (swelling) in one of the Bartholin glands. Treatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess. Surgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with medicine to make you sleepy. After surgery, you may need warm sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water) The abscesses may return in few cases. It is important to treat any vaginal infection that is diagnosed at the same time as theAbscess. Soaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help. Eating soft or liquid foods until abscess has healed is a good way to help the area heal. If abscess collection is deep, you might need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the Abscess drainage site.
