 Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of disorders in which skin blisters. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction. Herlitz JEB is the more severe form of the condition. It causes blistering over large regions of the body. The milder form of EB is called non-Herlitz. JEB may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows. Other treatments for this condition may include: Medicines that suppress the immune system. Protein and gene therapy and the use of the drug interferon are being studied. Skin grafting in places where sores are deep. Dilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing. Repair of hand deformities. Removal of any squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that develops. Follow these guidelines at home: Take good care of your skin to prevent infections. Follow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw. Do exercises a physical therapist shows you to help keep your joints and muscles mobile. Choose soft foods and avoid nuts, chips, and other crunchy foods if you have sores in your mouth. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or dressing, and if so, what type to use. You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. If you have a lot of skin injury, you may need extra calories and protein to help your skin heal. It is best to see a dentist who has experience treating people with EB.
