Women who are not physically active have a higher risk of getting breast cancer. Smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones due to night shift working also may increase breast cancer risk. Being overweight or obese after menopause has been found to raise risk. Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancerrisk. Geography (where you live) can affect your chances of getting cancer. Sometimes people in a family are more likely to have a certain cancer. A cancer-causing gene could run in that family. One cancer-Causing gene called BRCA increases the risk of breast cancer, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The risk for breast cancer increases with the more alcohol a woman drinks, as well as other factors such as smoking, smoking, and exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos, radon, benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride. The more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to develop breast cancer and other types of cancer. The higher your risk of developing breast cancer is, the higher your chance of developing other forms of the disease, such as ovarian cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, or prostate cancer.
