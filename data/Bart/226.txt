Stroke is the number one cause of serious adult disability in the United States. Speech therapy helps stroke patients relearn language and speaking skills. People with dysarthria have trouble making certain sounds or words. Dysarthria can be caused by a stroke, a head injury, or brain surgery. With time and patience, a stroke survivor should be able to regain some, and sometimes all,language and speaking abilities. For most stroke patients, rehabilitation mainly involves physical therapy. The aim of physical therapy is to have the stroke patient relearn simple motor activities such as walking, sitting, standing, lying down, and the process of switching from one type of movement to another. Another type of therapy to help Patients relearn daily activities is occupational therapy.
