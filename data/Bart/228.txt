 Occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears. The pain is often described as migraine-like and some patients may also experience symptoms common to migraines and cluster headaches. Causes can be the result of pinched nerves or muscle tightness in the neck. It can also be caused by a head or neck injury. A positive response (relief from pain) after an anesthetic nerve block will confirm the diagnosis. Symptoms include continuous aching, burning and throbbing with intermittent shocking or shooting pain that generally starts at the base of head and goes to the scalp on one or both sides of head. Patients often have pain behind the eye of the affected side of theHead. Patients may also have scalp tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light. The location of pain is related to the areas supplied by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, which run from the area where the spinal column meets the neck, up to the head. Some individuals will also experience pain in. the scalp, forehead, andbehind the eyes. Osteoarthritis, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and frequent lengthy. periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position are also associated with occipitals. In many cases, however, no cause can be found and a positive response from pain is needed to confirm a diagnosis of the condition. The symptoms of occipITAL neuralGia can either be primary or secondary. A secondary condition is associated with an underlying disease.
