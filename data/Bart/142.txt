Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can't make the extra insulin needed during pregnancy. Insulin, a hormone made in your pancreas, helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed in the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. Having a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor. Too much glucose in your blood is not good for you or your baby. You can protect your own and your baby's health by taking action right away to manage your blood sugar levels, such as changing your diet and exercising.
