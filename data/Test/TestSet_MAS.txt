5	However, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat another cause of an acute or subacute cough. For example, antibiotics may be given for pneumonia. Determining the cause of chronic cough is crucial to effective treatment. In many cases, more than one underlying condition may be causing your chronic cough. Acid blockers. If you are currently smoking, your doctor will discuss with you your readiness to quit and provide assistance to achieve this goal. If you're taking an ACE inhibitor medication, your doctor may switch you to another medicine that doesn't have cough as a side effect. Medications used to treat chronic cough may include: Antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. These drugs are standard treatment for allergies and postnasal drip. Inhaled asthma drugs. The most effective treatments for asthma-related cough are corticosteroids and bronchodilators, which reduce inflammation and open up your airways. If a bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial infection is causing your chronic cough, your doctor may prescribe medications to address the infection. Chronic Cough A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Treating the Cough Rather Than the Cause Coughing is important because it helps clear your airways of irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). Coughing also helps prevent infections. Cough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Medicines can help control a cough and make it easier to cough up mucus. Your doctor may recommend medicines such as: Prescription cough suppressants, also called antitussives. These medicines can help relieve a cough.
24	Primary familial brain calcification is caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most commonly mutated gene is called SLC20A2, and accounts for an estimated 40 percent of cases, followed by the PDGFRB gene, which is mutated in about 10 percent of cases. Testing that might be done includes biochemical analysis of blood and urine, as well as analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered.[1] Sequencing of SLC20A2 should be pursued first. If no mutation is identified, deletion / duplication analysis of SLC20A2 may be considered. If no identifiable mutation or deletion in SLC20A2 is found, sequence analysis of PDGFRB and PDGFB may be considered.[1] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Changes in other genes each account for a small percentage of cases. In about half of individuals with primary familial brain calcification the genetic cause is unknown. These individuals are thought to have mutations in genes that have not yet been linked to the condition. To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known. Medications can be used to treat symptoms associated with this condition, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence. Off label prescription of biphosphanates have been reported in few patients The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon:[1] 1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging, 2) presence of progressive neurological dysfunction, 3) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (a person must inherit one copy of the altered gene from one parent to have the condition). Molecular genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis.[1] Genetic testing may help to confirm the diagnosis. For individuals in who a diagnosis of PFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases.
38	Guillain-Barr√© syndrome can be a devastating disorder because of its sudden and rapid, unexpected onset of weakness‚Äîand usually actual paralysis. Fortunately, 70% of people with GBS eventually experience full recovery. Recovery can take weeks, months, or years. Most people survive and recover completely. In some people, mild weakness may persist. The outcome is likely to be good when the symptoms go away within 3 weeks after they first started. Possible complications of GBS include: Breathing difficulty (respiratory failure) Shortening of tissues in the joints (contractures) or other deformities Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) that form when the person with GBS is inactive or has to stay in bed Increased risk of infections Low or unstable blood pressure Paralysis that is permanent Pneumonia Skin damage (ulcers) Breathing food or fluids into the lungs About 15 percent of individuals experience long-term weakness; some may require ongoing use of a walker, wheelchair, or ankle support. Muscle strength may not return uniformly. With careful intensive care and successful treatment of infection, autonomic dysfunction and other medical complications, even those individuals with respiratory failure usually survive. Typically, the point of greatest weakness occurs days to at most 4 weeks after the first symptoms occur. Symptoms then stabilize at this level for a period of days, weeks, or, sometimes months. Some individuals still report ongoing improvement after 2 years. About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barr√© have residual weakness after 3 years. About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack.
94	Possible side effects include decreased sex drive and impotence. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH. The prostate gland is located underneath the bladder and is about the size of a chestnut. In this cut section, you can see that part of the urethra is encased within the prostate gland. As a man ages, the prostate typically enlarges in size in a process called benign hypertrophy, which means that the gland got larger without becoming cancerous. The enlarged prostate crowds its anatomical neighbors, particularly the urethra, causing it to narrow. The narrowed urethra results in several of the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, or BPH. Symptoms may include a slowed or delayed start in urination, the need to urinate frequently during the night, difficulty in emptying the bladder, a strong, sudden urge to urinate, and incontinence. Less than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease, or their symptoms are minor and do not restrict their life style. BPH is a normal physiological process of aging and treatment options are available. The choice of the appropriate treatment is based on the severity of the symptoms, the extent to which they affect lifestyle, and the presence of other medical conditions. Men with BPH should consult with their physician yearly to monitor the progression of the symptoms and decide the best course of treatment as needed. Watch out for drugs that may make your symptoms worse:SAW PALMETTOMany herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms. If you use saw palmetto and think it works, ask your doctor if you should still take it. This treatment is most often done on men who have very large prostate glands. Other less-invasive procedures use heat or a laser to destroy prostate tissue. Another less-invasive procedure works by "tacking" the prostate open without removing or destroying tissues. None have been proven to be better than TURP. People who receive these procedures are more likely to need surgery again after 5 or 10 years.
95	Stay away from large motors, generators, and equipment. DO NOT lean over the open hood of a car that is running. You will probably be able to go home after 1 day or even the same day in some cases. You should be able to return to your normal activity level quickly. Ask your provider how much you can use the arm on the side of your body where the pacemaker was placed. You may be advised not to: Lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms) Push, pull, and twist your arm for 2 to 3 weeks. Raise your arm above your shoulder for several weeks. When you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your pacemaker and has contact information for emergencies. You should always carry this wallet card with you. You should try to remember the name of the pacemaker manufacturer if you can in case you lose your card. Also stay away from: Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers Large electrical- or gasoline-powered appliances If you have a cell phone: DO NOT put it in a pocket on the same side of your body as your pacemaker. Always ask your provider about any specific device that you need to avoid. DO NOT put a magnet near your pacemaker. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, computers and fax machines, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwaves. You should keep several devices at least 12 inches (30 centimeters) away from the site where the pacemaker is placed under your skin. These include: Battery powered cordless tools (such as screwdrivers and drills) Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws) Electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers Slot machines Stereo speakers Tell all providers that you have a pacemaker before any tests are done. Some medical equipment may interfere with your pacemaker.
97	Sensorineural deafness is a type of hearing loss. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or the brain. They include: Buildup of wax in the ear canal Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum Fluid remaining in the ear after an ear infection Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal Hole in the eardrum Scar on the eardrum from repeated infections Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed. Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by: Acoustic neuroma Age-related hearing loss Childhood infections, such as meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever, and measles Mnire' disease Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation) Use of certain medicines Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to: Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known) Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, or herpes The ear can also be injured by: Assistive Listening Devices Assistive listening devices devices can help you hear in certain listening environments. These can include telephone and cell phone amplifying devices, smart phone or tablet "apps," and closed circuit systems (induction coil loops) in places of worship, theaters, and auditoriums. TV listening systems help you listen to the television or the radio without being bothered by other noises around you. Some hearing aids can be plugged into televisions or stereos to help you hear better. Cochlear Implant Over 30 states in the United States require newborn hearing screenings. If your hearing loss is severe and of a certain type, your doctor may suggest that you talk to an otolaryngologist about a cochlear implant. An otolaryngologist is a surgeon who specializes in ear, nose, and throat diseases. A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that the surgeon places under the skin and behind the ear. The device picks up sounds, changes them to electrical signals, and sends them past the non-working part of the inner ear and on to the brain. Hearing through a cochlear implant sounds different from normal hearing, but it lets many people communicate orally in person and over the telephone, and perceive sounds in the environment. Treating hearing loss early can allow many infants to develop normal language skills without delay. In infants born with hearing loss, treatments should start as early as age 6 months. Treatment depends on the baby's overall health and the cause of hearing loss. Treatment may include: Speech therapy Learning sign language Cochlear implant (for those with profound sensorineural hearing loss) Treating the cause of hearing loss may include: Medicines for infections Ear tubes for repeated ear infections Surgery to correct structural problems Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum, often from scuba diving Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear) Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones The eardrum is not vibrating in response to sound. Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated.
102	The outlook for people with transverse myelitis varies. Most recovery occurs within 3 months after the condition occurs. Ongoing treatment with chemical agents that modify immune response (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate or oral cyclophosphamide) can be considered for the small subset of patients that experience recurrent transverse myelitis.[4] Individuals with permanent physical disabilities may benefit from physical therapy , occupational therapy and vocational therapy.[1] FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition. Therapy generally begins when the patient first experiences symptoms. Physicians often prescribe corticosteroid therapy during the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. Although no clinical trials have investigated whether corticosteroids alter the course of transverse myelitis, these drugs often are prescribed to reduce immune system activity because of the suspected autoimmune mechanisms involved in the disorder. Corticosteroid medications that might be prescribed may include methylprednisone or dexamethasone.[1] Chronic pain is a common complication of transverse myelitis. Plasma exchange therapy is often used for those with moderate to severe transverse myelitis who dont show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids.[4][5] This therapy involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which blood cells are suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma loss with special fluids. It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removes antibodies that are involved in inflammation.[5] Some patients respond very well to intravenous cyclophosphamide (a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia). It is very important that an experienced oncology team be involved in the administration of this drug, and patients should be monitored carefully. Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord, which carries nerve signals from the brain to the rest of the body. The segment of the spinal cord that has inflammation or damage determines the symptoms a person has. Generally, inflammation at one segment causes symptoms at that level and below that level. Most commonly, the upper spinal cord is affected, causing impaired leg movement, and problems controlling the bowel and bladder. The onset of symptoms may be acute (sudden, developing over hours or days) or subacute (developing over weeks).[1] The cause of transverse myelitis may be unknown (idiopathic) or it may be associated with a wide variety of underlying health problems, including infections, immune system disorders, and other inflammatory disorders.[1][2] Tests that may be used to diagnose transverse myelitis include MRI to look for compression or inflammation of the spinal cord, and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look for evidence of inflammation in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide.[1][2] Some people have full or partial recovery from symptoms, while others do not recover any lost function in the affected parts of the body.[3] Most people recover at least partially, although recovery can take up to 2 or 3 years. In general however, if there is no improvement within the first 6 months, a significant recovery is not likely.[1] About a third of people with transverse myelitis recover completely. Some people recover with moderate disabilities, such as bowel problems and trouble walking. Others have permanent disability and need help with daily activities. Those who may have poor chance of recovery are: People who have rapid onset of symptoms People whose symptoms do not improve within the first 3 to 6 months Transverse myelitis usually only occurs once in most people. It may recur in some people with an underlying cause, such as MS. People who have involvement of only on one side of the spinal cord may be more likely to develop MS in the future. Treatments are designed to manage and alleviate symptoms and largely depend upon the severity of neurological involvement.
103	If you're at risk for glaucoma, get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years. That way, if your doctor finds glaucoma, you can start treatment to lower the pressure in your eyes, even if you dont have symptoms yet. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. Daily treatment will be needed to prevent vision loss. Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes vision loss. It usually happens when pressure from extra fluid within your eyeball damages the nerve in your eye (optic nerve). Vision loss usually happens slowly, so you may not notice it right away Glaucoma gets worse over time It can cause lasting vision loss and blindness if not treated Special eye drops (prescribed by your doctor) can lower the pressure in your eye Get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years to detect glaucoma early and help prevent vision loss If you have glaucoma, the doctor will need to check the pressure in your eyes often Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. The most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye.
105	Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined. A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person's medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. - Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. - Neurological tests. Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency.
110	According to many investigators, acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother. In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease but usually will not show symptoms. When acrocallosal syndrome is caused by KIF7 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Acrocallosal syndrome (or severe Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant , which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.
115	Similarities:For both COVID-19 and flu, it?s possible to spread the virus for at least 1 day before experiencing any symptoms. Differences:If a person has COVID-19, they may be contagious for a longer period of time than if they had flu. For adults who never develop symptoms, isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Role of viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen) * ** to discontinue isolation or precautions For adults who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the strategy outlined in Part 1, above. Viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen)*** and quarantine after discontinuation of isolation or precautions For adults previously diagnosed with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic after recovery, retesting or quarantine is not recommended if another exposure occurs or might have occurred within 90 days after the date of symptom onset from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. FluMost people with flu are contagious for about 1 day before they show symptoms. Older children and adults with flu appear to be most contagious during the initial 3-4 days of their illness but many remain contagious for about 7 days. Infants and people with weakened immune systems can be contagious for even longer. COVID-19How long someone can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 is still under investigation. It?s possible for people to spread the virus for about 2 days before experiencing signs or symptoms and remain contagious for at least 10 days after signs or symptoms first appeared. If someone is asymptomatic or their symptoms go away, it?s possible to remain contagious for at least 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Duration of isolation and precautions For most adults with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset* and after resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms. Some adults with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset; severely immunocompromised patients** may produce replication-competent virus beyond 20 days and require additional testing and consultation with infectious diseases specialists and infection control experts.
116	Some tips that may help reduce swelling: Put your legs on pillows to raise them above your heart while lying down. Exercise your legs. When lying down, keep your arms and legs above your heart level, if possible, so the fluid can drain. DO NOT do this if you get shortness of breath. See your provider instead. This helps pump fluid from your legs back to your heart. Follow a low-salt diet, which may reduce fluid buildup and swelling. Wear support stockings (sold at most drugstores and medical supply stores). When traveling, take breaks often to stand up and move around. Avoid wearing tight clothing or garters around your thighs. Lose weight if you need to. Follow your health care provider's treatment recommendations. If you have long-term swelling, ask your provider about options to prevent skin breakdown, such as: - Flotation ring - Lamb's wool pad - Pressure-reducing mattress Continue with your everyday activities.
117	Pandemic Influenza outbreaks have been predictably unpredictable in the years since 1918 but always global, and needing a global response. One million people around the world died in a 1957 outbreak which started in China but spread globally. Aligned with the general programme of work 2019-2023 (GPW13), the new strategy will support WHO Member States in developing seasonal influenza prevention and control capacities. These national efforts, in turn, will build greater global preparedness for the next pandemic. Globally, the strategy will focus on research and innovation. This will include improved influenza modelling and forecasting, along with the development of new vaccines, including a possible universal influenza vaccine. This page links all WHO technical and general information on influenza In 1968, another outbreak took 1 to 3 million lives. In 2003, A(H5N1) or so-called Avian Influenza highlighted how the virus could pass from animals to humans, but it did not reach the pandemic stage because it did not pass from human to human. The 2009 Swine flu A(H1N1) pandemic, started in Mexico and spread to over 214 countries and overseas territories or communities. The world was lucky: it turned out to be even milder than some seasonal epidemics. Researchers are always on the lookout, though, because the next outbreak could be far worse. WHO/SEARO/T.Pietrasik WHO is working closely with Ministries of Health, regional and national influenza research and surveillance centres, and other stakeholders to develop a multi-layered approach to preparing for and responding to both seasonal flu outbreaks and pandemics. Specific WHO programmes include the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, which helps developing countries access vaccines, antivirals, and diagnostics to both prepare for and manage pandemics. WHO and partners are developing a Global Influenza Strategy to be launched in 2018.

121	Using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 912 patients were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. The tablet may be taken with or without food, and the liquid must be taken with food. To help you remember to take cefuroxime, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly. The tablets should be swallowed whole and taken with a full glass of water. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of cefuroxime axetil tablet-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events was very similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with the higher recommended doses.¬†The following adverse events were thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to cefuroxime axetil tablets in multiple-dose clinical trials (n = 912 cefuroxime axetil-treated patients).¬† Cefuroxime comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours (twice a day) for 7-10 days. Children who cannot swallow the tablet whole should take the liquid instead. Stopping cefuroxime too soon may cause bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. To treat gonorrhea, cefuroxime is taken as a single dose, and to treat Lyme disease, cefuroxime is taken twice a day for 20 days.
122	Each of your body's cells contains genes. Genes are the instructions that tell each of your cells what to do. Not being physically active. Women who are not physically active have a higher risk of getting breast cancer. Research suggests that other factors such as smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones due to night shift working also may increase breast cancer risk. Being overweight or obese after menopause. Older women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting breast cancer than those at a normal weight. Taking hormones. Some forms of hormone replacement therapy (those that include both estrogen and progesterone) taken during menopause can raise risk for breast cancer when taken for more than five years. Certain oral contraceptives (birth control pills) also have been found to raise breast cancer risk. Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancer risk. Drinking alcohol. Genes tell cells when to grow, when to stop growing, and what substances to make. Being around certain things can raise your chances of cancer, including: Tobacco smoke: Lung, mouth, throat, esophagus, kidney, and bladder cancers Asbestos (a mineral fiber used for insulation and other building materials): Lung cancer and mesothelioma (cancer in the tissues that line your lungs) Sunlight: Skin cancer X-rays: Leukemia and cancer in the organ exposed to radiation Radon (a radioactive gas that comes from the ground and can build up to harmful levels in basements): Lung cancer Some chemicals used at work (such as benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride) can cause cancer. Geography (where you live) can affect your chances of getting cancer. One reason is that people in different areas may be exposed to different amounts of carcinogens. Another reason is that people in different areas may have different genetic risk factors. For example, certain genes tell cells in your stomach to make stomach acid. Sometimes one of your genes can go bad in ways that make a cell turn cancerous. A gene can go bad if: The gene was damaged by something you were exposed to (an environmental factor) The gene was copied incorrectly during normal cell growth Less likely, you inherited a cancer gene from one of your parents. Sometimes people in a family are more likely to have a certain cancer. A cancer-causing gene could run in that family. One cancer-causing gene called BRCA increases the risk of breast cancer.
125	Scientists are exploring how lupus develops and how therapies affect the course of the disease. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise to help keep your body strong; however, talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program. If you start to plan a pregnancy, talk to your doctor so you can be as healthy as possible before becoming pregnant. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise to help keep your body strong; however, talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program. Most people with mild disease or who are in remission can usually participate in the same life activities they did before they were diagnosed. Pregnancy and Contraception for Women With Lupus Most women with lupus can have healthy pregnancies if the disease is under control. If you start to plan a pregnancy, talk to your doctor so you can be as healthy as possible before becoming pregnant. Close monitoring during pregnancy is essential, especially if you have low platelets, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, high blood pressure, lung or heart problems, or kidney disease. Scientists are exploring how lupus develops and how therapies affect the course of the disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body. Lupus occurs when the immune system, which normally helps protect the body from infection and disease, attacks its own tissues. This attack causes inflammation, and in some cases permanent tissue damage, which can be widespread affecting the skin, joints, heart, lung, kidneys, circulating blood cells, and brain. If you have lupus, you may experience periods of illness (flares) and periods of wellness (remission). Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body. Lupus occurs when the immune system, which normally helps protect the body from infection and disease, attacks its own tissues. This attack causes inflammation, and in some cases permanent tissue damage, which can be widespread affecting the skin, joints, heart, lung, kidneys, circulating blood cells, and brain. If you have lupus, you may experience periods of illness (flares) and periods of wellness (remission). They are also exploring drugs to prevent or delay kidney failure, one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of lupus. Experts are also collaborating to develop registries and working groups, such as: The Lupus Family Registry and Repository, which gathers medical information as well as blood and tissue samples from patients and their relatives. This will help identify genes that make someone more at risk for the disease. Scientists are exploring how lupus develops and how therapies affect the course of the disease. They are also exploring drugs to prevent or delay kidney failure, one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of lupus. Experts are also collaborating to develop registries and working groups, such as: The Lupus Family Registry and Repository, which gathers medical information as well as blood and tissue samples from patients and their relatives.
129	You will get a prescription to buy special catheters at a medical supply store. Other supplies you will need are sterile gloves, a catheter pack, syringes, sterile solution to clean with, gel such as K-Y Jelly or Surgilube (DO NOT use Vaseline), and a drainage bag. You will need to check your catheter and bag throughout the day. Always keep your bag below your waist. Try not to disconnect the catheter more than you need to. Keeping it connected to the bag will make it work better. Check for kinks, and move the tubing around if it is not draining. Drink plenty of water during the day to keep urine flowing. Drink 8 to 12 glasses of water every day for a few days after you change your catheter. Avoid physical activity for a week or two. Once your catheter is in place, you will need to empty your urine bag only a few times a day. Caring for Your Skin Near your Catheter : Follow these guidelines for good health and skin care: - Check the catheter site a few times a day. Check for redness, pain, swelling, or pus. - Wash the area around your catheter every day with mild soap and water. You may need a catheter because you have urinary incontinence (leakage), urinary retention (not being able to urinate), surgery that made a catheter necessary, or another health problem. Make Sure Your Catheter Is Working : You will need to check your catheter and bag throughout the day. When to Call the Doctor : Call your health care provider if: - You are having trouble changing your catheter or emptying your bag.
131	Nerve damage can also lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold. Follow a healthy eating plan, including eating more fruits and vegetables and less sugar and salt. There are many possible causes of numbness and tingling, including: Sitting or standing in the same position for a long time Injuring a nerve (a neck injury may cause you to feel numbness anywhere along your arm or hand, while a low back injury can cause numbness or tingling down the back of your leg) Pressure on the nerves of the spine, such as from a herniated disk Pressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors, scar tissue, or infection Shingles or herpes zoster infection Other infections such as HIV/AIDS, leprosy, syphilis, or tuberculosis Lack of blood supply to an area, such as from hardening of the arteries, frostbite, or vessel inflammation Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body Deficiency of B vitamins such as B1, B6, B12, or folic acid Use of certain medicines Use of certain illicit street drugs Nerve damage due to lead, alcohol, or tobacco, or from chemotherapy drugs Radiation therapy Animal bites Insect, tick, mite, and spider bites Seafood toxins Congenital conditions that affect the nerves Numbness and tingling can be caused by other medical conditions, including: Carpal tunnel syndrome (pressure on a nerve at the wrist) Diabetes Migraines Multiple sclerosis Seizures Stroke Transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a "mini-stroke" Underactive thyroid Raynaud phenomenon (narrowing of the blood vessels, usually in the hands and feet) Fungus infections such as athlete?s foot between your toes. A blister, sore, ulcer, infected corn, or ingrown toenail. Most people with diabetes can prevent serious foot complications. Tingling, burning, or pain in your feet. Loss of sense of touch or ability to feel heat or cold very well. A change in the shape of your feet over time. Loss of hair on your toes, feet, and lower legs. Get physically active ?10 to 20 minutes a day is better than an hour once a week. Dry, cracked skin on your feet. A change in the color and temperature of your feet. Thickened, yellow toenails. Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but they are often felt in your fingers, hands, feet, arms, or legs. Living without pain sounds pretty good, but it comes at a high cost. Pain is the body?s way of telling you something?s wrong so you can take care of yourself. Small problems can become serious if they aren?t treated early. Preventing Nerve Damage What?s the most important thing you can do to prevent nerve damage or stop it from getting worse? Keep your blood sugar in your target range as much as possible. Other good diabetes management habits can help, too: Don?t smoke. Smoking reduces blood flow to the feet.
133	You may need to wear a sling, splint, or cast for about 2 to 3 weeks while your elbow heals. Depending on how badly it is sprained, you may need to work with a physical therapist who will show you stretching and strengthening exercises. Cold from the ice can damage your skin. Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap. Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart. Steps for first aid treatment of a crush injury are: Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure. Cover the area with a wet cloth or bandage. Then, raise the area above the level of the heart, if possible. If there is suspicion of a head, neck, or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement to only the crushed area. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or local hospital for further advice. Crush injuries most often need to be evaluated in a hospital emergency department. Surgery may be needed. Most people recover completely from a simple elbow sprain in about 4 weeks. Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Wrap the ice in cloth. DO NOT place ice directly on the skin.
136	You can try the following home care steps to ease mild abdominal pain: - Sip water or other clear fluids. These additional steps may help prevent some types of abdominal pain: - Drink plenty of water each day. - Eat small meals more frequently. - Call your health care provider if: Waking to urinate more often continues over several days. You are bothered by the number of times you must urinate during the night. Cramp-like pain: This type of pain is not serious most of the time. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever. - Colicky pain: This type of pain comes in waves. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain. For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis. However, life-threatening conditions, such as colon cancer or early appendicitis, may only cause mild pain or no pain. Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include: - Generalized pain: This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines. - Localized pain: This is pain found in only one area of your belly. For example, you may have abdominal pain if you have: Severe menstrual cramps Endometriosis Muscle strain Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Tubal (ectopic) pregnancy Ruptured ovarian cyst Urinary tract infections Sometimes, you may only need to call a health care provider if your symptoms continue. Less serious causes of abdominal pain include: Constipation Irritable bowel syndrome Food allergies or intolerance (such as lactose intolerance) Food poisoning Stomach flu Other possible causes include: Appendicitis Abdominal aortic aneurysm (bulging and weakening of the major artery in the body) Bowel blockage or obstruction Cancer of the stomach, colon (large bowel), and other organs Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones Decreased blood supply to the intestines (ischemic bowel) Diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of the colon) Heartburn, indigestion, or gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) Ulcers Sometimes, abdominal pain may occur due to a problem somewhere else in your body, such as your chest or pelvic area. - If you have been vomiting, wait 6 hours, and then eat small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. - If the pain is high up in your abdomen and occurs after meals, antacids may help, especially if you feel heartburn or indigestion. Avoid citrus, high-fat foods, fried or greasy foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. - Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory medications, and narcotic pain pills unless your health care provider prescribes them. If you know that your pain is not related to your liver, you can try acetaminophen (Tylenol).
140	Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression.1 It is more than twice as common for African-American, Hispanic, and white women to have depression compared to Asian-American women. Depression is also more common in women whose families live below the federal poverty line.3 Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S. Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression is now recognized as occurring in children and adolescents, although it sometimes presents with more prominent irritability than low mood. Depression, especially in midlife or older adults, can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Parkinsons disease. Sometimes medications taken for these physical illnesses may cause side effects that contribute to depression. Risk factors include: Personal or family history of depression Major life changes, trauma, or stress Certain physical illnesses and medications Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have symptoms of depression. Certain medicines and some health problems (such as viruses or a thyroid disorder) can cause the same symptoms as depression. Diagnosis of depression includes a mental health professional asking questions about your life, emotions, struggles, and symptoms. The doctor, nurse, or mental health professional may order lab tests on a sample of your blood or urine and do a regular checkup to rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms. You may also be going through difficult life events, such as physical or psychological trauma, losing a loved one, a difficult relationship with a family member or friend, or financial troubles. For older adults who experience depression for the first time later in life, other factors may be at play. Depression may be related to changes that occur in the brain and body as a person ages. For example, some older adults who are at risk for illnesses such as heart disease or stroke may have hardening and inflammation of the blood vessels, and blood may not be able to flow normally to the body's organs, including the brain. Over time, this blood vessel disease and restricted blood flow can damage nearby brain tissue and harm the nerve connections that help different parts of the brain communicate with each other. If this happens, an older adult with no family history of depression may develop what some doctors call "vascular depression." Older adults may also experience depression as a result of brain changes caused by illnesses such as Alzheimers disease or Parkinsons disease. However, laboratory tests may help a doctor determine whether depression is caused by a hormonal or other physical disorder. People who have severely disturbed sleep may need to have testing (polysomnography) to distinguish sleep disorders from depression. Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as: Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder. Postpartum depression is much more serious than the baby blues (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with postpartum depression experience full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany postpartum depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies. Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations).
141	In addition to FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent, one other flu vaccine is licensed specifically for people 65 years and older. The high-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent) contains four times the amount of antigen as the standard-dose inactivated flu vaccine, and has been associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination and better effectiveness than the regular dose flu vaccine in older people in a two-season randomized trial. Getting the flu vaccine every year is the best way to lower your chance of getting the flu and spreading it to others. The flu vaccine causes antibodies to develop in your body about two weeks after you get it. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine. There are different types of flu shots, including some especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season. People in this age group may also receive standard-dose, flu vaccines without adjuvant or the recombinant flu vaccine. People 65 years and older can get any flu vaccine approved for use in that age group with no preference for any one vaccine over another. In the United States, FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent are licensed only for persons aged 65 years and older. FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent should not be given to people with a history of severe allergic reaction to the any flu vaccine or to vaccine ingredients other than eggs. Information about vaccine ingredients is located in package inserts from each manufacturer. People with egg allergies should check with their doctors before getting a vaccine. Other exceptions are people who have Had reactions to flu shots before Guillain-Barre Syndrome A fever Centers for Disease Control and Prevention But it can be serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death.
142	Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can't make the extra insulin needed during pregnancy. Insulin, a hormone made in your pancreas, helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Diabetes means your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Too much glucose in your blood is not good for you or your baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed in the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. Managing your gestational diabetes can help you and your baby stay healthy. You can protect your own and your baby's health by taking action right away to manage your blood glucose levels. Having a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. During pregnancy, your body makes special hormones and goes through other changes, such as weight gain. Because of these changes, your body's cells don't use insulin well, a condition called insulin resistance. All pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Being overweight or obese is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or obese may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.
143	Metoprolol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - dizziness or lightheadedness - tiredness - depression - nausea - dry mouth - stomach pain - vomiting - gas or bloating - heartburn - constipation - rash or itching - cold hands and feet - runny nose Some side effects can be serious. Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious. Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can be mild or life-threatening. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately: - shortness of breath - wheezing - swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs - weight gain - fainting - rapid, pounding, or irregular heartbeat Metoprolol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medication, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions. One problem is interactions, which may occur between Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit Drugs and supplements, such as ginkgo and blood thinners Drugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers Interactions can change the actions of one or both drugs. The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects.
144	The main treatment for lactic acidosis is to correct the medical problem that causes the condition. Lactic acidosis refers to lactic acid build up in the bloodstream. Lactic acid is produced when oxygen levels, become low in cells within the areas of the body where metabolism takes place. The most common cause of lactic acidosis is severe medical illness in which blood pressure is low and too little oxygen is reaching the bodys tissues. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary cause lactic acidosis. Certain diseases can also cause the condition including: AIDS Alcoholism Cancer Cirrhosis Cyanide poisoning Kidney failure Respiratory failure Sepsis (severe infection) Some medicines can rarely cause lactic acidosis: Certain inhalers used to treat asthma or COPD Epinephrine An antibiotic called linezolid Metformin, used to treat diabetes (most often when overdosed) One type of medicine used to treat HIV infection Propofol
145	For people who are age 20 or older: Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years What affects my cholesterol levels? Losing weight can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. You should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines. Who needs cholesterol medicines? Your health care provider may prescribe medicine if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher What are the different types of medicines for cholesterol? There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol Bile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides. Nicotinic acid (niacin), which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL (good) cholesterol. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your health care provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your health care provider will consider Your cholesterol levels Your risk for heart disease and stroke Your age Any other health problems you have Possible side effects of the medicines. Medicines can help control your cholesterol, but they don't cure it. You need to keep taking your medicines and get regular cholesterol checks to make sure that you cholesterol levels are in a healthy range. It also raises your HDL (good) cholesterol level. Physical Activity. Not being physically active is a risk factor for heart disease. Regular physical activity can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Things outside of your control that can also affect cholesterol levels include: Age and Gender. After the age of menopause, women's LDL (bad) cholesterol levels tend to rise. A blood test called a lipoprotein panel can measure your cholesterol levels. The test gives information about your Total cholesterol - a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood.
148	Blood Flow to the Heart Is Blocked The heart works 24 hours a day, pumping oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body. Blood is supplied to the heart through its coronary arteries. A heart attack is when blood flow to part of your heart is suddenly blocked and some of your heart muscle dies. Doctors use the term myocardial infarction to refer to a heart attack. Myocardium is a word for heart muscle, and infarction is a word for blocked blood flow. So a myocardial infarction is a heart attack. Go to an emergency department and chew on an aspirin tablet if you think you're having a heart attack You may have chest pressure, shortness of breath, and a tired feeling if you're having a heart problem Sometimes a heart attack may cause mild symptoms or none at all (silent heart attack) Doctors do blood tests and ECG/EKG if you have symptoms of a heart attack Doctors will give you medicine and do procedures to try to get more blood to the affected area of your heart Having a heart attack increases your chances of having another one. Therefore, it is very important that you and your family know how and when to seek medical attention. Talk to your doctor about making an emergency action plan, and discuss it with your family. The emergency action plan should include - warning signs or symptoms of a heart attack - instructions for accessing emergency medical services in your community, including calling 9-1-1 - steps you can take while waiting for medical help to arrive, such as taking aspirin and nitroglycerin - important information to take along with you to the hospital, such as a list of medications that you take or that you are allergic to, and name and number of whom you should contact if you go to the hospital. Prompt Treatment Is Important Heart attack treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Angina is a recurring pain or discomfort in the chest that happens when some part of the heart does not receive enough blood. An episode of angina is not a heart attack. However, people with angina may have a hard time telling the difference between angina and heart attack symptoms. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle does not get enough blood. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It is usually relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medicine. Prompt treatment of a heart attack can help prevent or limit damage to the heart and prevent sudden death. Call 9-1-1 Right Away A heart attack is an emergency. Call 9-1-1 for an ambulance right away -- within 5 minutes -- if you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack. If a blood clot suddenly blocks a coronary artery, it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks.
151	DIETARY TIPS FOR VEGETARIANSWhen following a vegetarian diet, keep in mind the following: Eat different kinds of foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy and eggs if your diet includes these. Choose fortified foods, such as cereals, breads, soy or almond milk, and fruits juices to get a full range of nutrients. These include: Vegetables Fruits Whole grains Legumes Seeds Nuts May include eggs and/or milk if ovo-lacto vegetarian A vegetarian diet contains no animal proteins. A semi-vegetarian diet is a meal plan that contains little animal protein, but mostly plant-based foods. No animal proteins or animal by-products such as eggs, milk, or honey. Lacto-vegetarian: Includes plant foods plus some or all dairy products. Lacto-ovo vegetarian: Includes plant foods, dairy products, and eggs. Semi- or partial vegetarian: Includes plant foods and may include chicken or fish, dairy products, and eggs. Summary A vegetarian diet focuses on plants for food. These include fruits, vegetables, dried beans and peas, grains, seeds and nuts. Limit foods that are high in sugar, salt (sodium), and fat. There is no single type of vegetarian diet. Instead, vegetarian eating patterns usually fall into the following groups: The vegan diet, which excludes all meat and animal products The lacto vegetarian diet, which includes plant foods plus dairy products The lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, which includes both dairy products and eggs People who follow vegetarian diets can get all the nutrients they need. However, they must be careful to eat a wide variety of foods to meet their nutritional needs. Nutrients vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12. United States Department of Agriculture Include a protein source with all meals. If needed, take supplements if your diet lacks certain vitamins and minerals. Learn to read the Nutrition Facts Label on food packages. The label tells you the ingredients and nutrition contents of the food product. If you follow a more restrictive diet, you may want to work with a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough nutrients. It is a meal plan made up of foods that come mostly from plants. It does not include red meat.
152	Symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome often include a characteristic high-pitched, mewing cry that sounds like a kitten crying. This cry may be heard immediately after birth, lasts several weeks, and then disappears. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. About 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5, which results in the intellectual disability and health problems characteristic of this disorder. Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5.Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child. However, not all affected newborns have this distinct cry. An infant with this syndrome may have a low birth weight and a small head with many abnormal features, including a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. Often the infant seems limp. Webbed fingers and toes (syndactyly) and heart defects are common. There are significant limitations in mental and physical development. Many children with cri du chat syndrome survive to adulthood but have substantial disabilities. Most cases of cri-du-chat syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development.
153	Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a chronic, slow-growing lymphoproliferative disorder.[1] It usually affects older adults and is primarily found in the bone marrow, although lymph nodes and the spleen may be involved. Affected individuals have a high level of an antibody called immunoglobulin M (IgM) in their blood, which can cause thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity).[2] Although some individuals initially do not have symptoms and are diagnosed from routine blood work, common symptoms may include weakness, appetite loss and weight loss. This involves removing the blood, passing it through a machine that removes the part of the blood with the IgM antibody , and returning the blood to the body. Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is thought to result from a combination of genetic changes. The most common known genetic change associated with this condition is a mutation in the MYD88 gene, which is found in more than 90 percent of affected individuals. The mutations that cause Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the abnormal blood cells. Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is a rare blood cell cancer characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow. These proteins are then referred to as cryoglobulins, and their clumping causes a condition known as cryoglobulinemia. These abnormal cells produce excess amounts of IgM, a type of protein known as an immunoglobulin; the overproduction of this large protein is how the condition got its name ("macroglobulinemia").Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia usually begins in a person's sixties and is a slow-growing (indolent) cancer. Some affected individuals have elevated levels of IgM and lymphoplasmacytic cells but no symptoms of the condition; in these cases, the disease is usually found incidentally by a blood test taken for another reason. Features related to hyperviscosity syndrome include bleeding in the nose or mouth, blurring or loss of vision, headache, dizziness, and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). The occurrence of specific mutations in a specific gene, MYD88, commonly occur among patients with macroglobulinemia. For example, doctors may check a blood sample to determine if the numbers of red and white blood cells and platelets are normal. Treatment is often reserved for those with symptoms and may include various medications including corticosteroids , alkylating agents, biologic response modifiers and purine analogues.[1] An examination of a urine sample may show Bence Jones proteins (pieces of abnormal antibodies). A bone marrow biopsy may reveal an increased number of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which helps confirm the diagnosis of macroglobulinemia, and the appearance of these cells helps differentiate this disorder from multiple myeloma. X-rays may show a loss of bone density (osteoporosis). Many people who have macroglobulinemia have no symptoms, and the disorder is discovered by chance when an elevated level of blood proteins is found during routine blood tests. Other people have symptoms resulting from interference with blood flow to the skin, fingers, toes, nose, and brain that occurs when the large quantity of macroglobulins thickens the blood (hyperviscosity syndrome). Precipitates of cryoglobulins can trigger inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), which causes various symptoms, such as bruises, joint aches, and weakness. These symptoms include bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes (such as the lining of the mouth, nose, and digestive tract), fatigue, weakness, headache, confusion, dizziness, and even coma. Removal of a large amount of plasma (the liquid part of blood) plus plasma transfusions (plasma exchange) may help, especially when combined with interferon. There are also several new drugs and drug combinations that are being studied in clinical trials.[2] More detailed information about the specific medications used to treat Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site. For individuals requiring treatment, the type and severity of symptoms present, aggressiveness of the disease, and age all play a role in the type of therapy chosen.[2][1] Some affected individuals have a procedure called plasmapheresis, to reverse or prevent the symptoms associated with the thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity).
155	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease characterized by deterioration or breakdown of the macula, which is responsible for sharp, central vision. In neovascular AMD, also called ‚Äúwet‚Äù AMD, blood vessels begin to grow up from the choroid (the bed of blood vessels below the retina) and into the retina. Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. Summary Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. These new and abnormal blood vessels leak fluid into the macula and cause macular edema. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that causes the macula to lose its normal structure (called degeneration). AMD is more common in older people In severe cases, it can lead to blindness Certain vitamins may help slow vision loss from AMD Some people need special treatments to slow down vision loss from AMD There are two types of AMD. First you get: Dry AMD, in which cells in the macula die slowly and cause a steady loss of vision After you have had dry AMD for a while, you might get: Wet AMD, in which new abnormal blood vessels grow under the damaged macula and leak blood, causing faster vision loss Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. Viewing the Retina It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form. Wet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. Dry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.
158	Call your provider if: Your stoma is swelling and is more than a half inch (1 centimeter) larger than normal. It will be pink or red, moist, and a little shiny. Stool that comes from your ileostomy is thin or thick liquid, or it may be pasty. It is not solid like the stool that comes from your colon. Foods you eat, medicines you take, and other things may change how thin or thick your stool is. You will need to empty the pouch 5 to 8 times a day. Some foods will loosen your stools and can increase output after you eat them. If you believe a certain food has caused a change in your stools, do not eat it for a while, and then try again. These foods may make your stools looser: Milk, fruit juice, and raw fruits and vegetables Prune juice, licorice, large meals, spicy foods, beer, red wine, and chocolate Some foods will make your stool thicker. Some of these are applesauce, baked potatoes, rice, bread, peanut butter, pudding, and baked apples. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of fluid a day. If you have diarrhea or your stools are looser or more watery: Drink extra fluids with electrolytes (sodium, potassium). Drinks such as Gatorade, PowerAde, or Pedialyte contain electrolytes. Drinking soda, milk, juice, or tea will help you get enough liquids. Try to eat foods that have potassium and sodium every day to keep your potassium and sodium levels from getting too low. Tips for when no stool is coming from your stoma: Try loosening the opening of the pouch if you think it is too tight. Change your position. Some signs of blockage are sudden cramping in your belly, a swollen stoma, nausea (with or without vomiting), and sudden increase of very watery output. Some signs are dry mouth, urinating less often, and feeling lightheaded or weak. Drinking hot tea and other liquids may flush any foods that are blocking the stoma. There will be times when nothing comes out of your ileostomy for a little while. Call your provider right away if your ileostomy bag stays empty longer than 4 to 6 hours. Some foods that may block your stoma are raw pineapple, nuts and seeds, celery, popcorn, corn, dried fruits (such as raisins), mushrooms, chunky relishes, coconut, and some Chinese vegetables. Your stoma has turned purple, black, or white. You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.
160	Diabetes is a disease caused by high levels of blood sugar (glucose) in your body. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: Type 1 diabetes is less common. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Researchers do not know the exact causes of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Researchers do know that inheriting certain genes from your family can raise your risk for developing diabetes. If your body does not make enough insulin, or your body does not use the insulin correctly, the glucose stays and builds up in your blood. And the more you smoke the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems if you already have diabetes.16Weight loss can help control type 2 diabetes so that you are healthier. But, obesity and smoking do not always cause diabetes. Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Genetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action Some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. Damage to or Removal of the Pancreas Pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.
161	Low-grade NHL often cannot be cured by chemotherapy alone. Low-grade NHL progresses slowly and may take many years before the disease gets worse or even requires treatment. Children with more extensive disease, especially involving the bone marrow and central nervous system , have long-term survival rates of 50-90%.[2] While the majority of adults with BL also achieve long-term remission with aggressive therapy, adults (particularly those with advanced stage disease) do more poorly than children.[2][7] In addition to the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis, prognosis depends on the age of the adult. In general, survival rates decrease with age and are lowest for elderly patients.[2] Unfortunately, specific statistics regarding the prognosis for adults with BL appear to be more scarce.[8] The outlook is poor for both children and adults if BL returns after improvement (relapses) or does not go into remission as a result of the first cycle of chemotherapy .[9][2] Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL). In MCL, there are cancerous B-cells (a type of immune system cell). The cancerous B-cells are within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone.[1] Although MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed. In these situations, treatment must be intensive since MCL can become life threatening within a short period of time.[2][3] MCL accounts for 6% of all NHL's and is mostly found in males during their early 60s.[4][2][3] More than one half of people with BL can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. The need for treatment is usually determined by symptoms, how fast the disease is progressing, and if blood counts are low. The cure rate may be lower if the cancer spreads to the bone marrow or spinal fluid. Diagnostic methods Diagnosis is based on histological analysis of the adenopathy, a complete blood count, measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and biopsy analysis of a lymph node. The observation of the translocation t(14;18) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in addition to suggested histological results, confirms the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnoses include chronic lymphocytic B cell leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and MALT lymphoma (see these terms). In the case of advanced stage lymphoma, chemotherapy with immuno-chemotherapy should be offered (rituximab combined with CHOP). In cases of chemosensitive relapse, treatment can be intensified. The median age at diagnosis is 60-65 years. Chemotherapy may cure many types of high-grade lymphomas. Symptoms appear at an advanced stage of the disease and can include fever, night sweats and weight loss. At diagnosis, patients usually present with adenopathy and, in 50% of cases, splenomegaly. However, the majority of people treated with aggressive therapy achieve long-term remission .[5] In general, children with BL have better survival rates than adults with BL. The prognosis in children correlates with the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis.
165	Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. This condition is also called an elbow subluxation (a partial dislocation). Other common causes of elbow pain are: Bursitis -- inflammation of a fluid-filled cushion beneath the skin Arthritis -- narrowing of the joint space and loss of cartilage in the elbow Elbow strains Infection of the elbow Tendon tears -- biceps rupture Golfers are more likely to injure the tendons on the inside of the elbow. Other common causes of elbow tendinitis are gardening, playing baseball, using a screwdriver, or overusing your wrist and arm. Young children commonly develop "nursemaid elbow," which often occurs when someone is pulling on their straightened arm. You will be asked about your medical history and symptoms such as: Are both elbows affected? You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Treatment depends on the cause, but may involve: Antibiotics Corticosteroid shots Manipulation Pain medicine Physical therapy Surgery (last resort) Does the pain shift from the elbow to other joints? Is the pain over the outside bony prominence of the elbow? Did the pain begin suddenly and severely? Did the pain begin slowly and mildly and then get worse? What makes the pain better or worse? Is there pain that goes from the elbow down to the hand? Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. The pain is due to a direct elbow injury. You have fever or swelling and redness of your elbow. Your elbow is locked and can't straighten or bend. A child has elbow pain. Gently try to move the elbow and increase your range of motion. If this hurts or you cannot move the elbow, call your health care provider. You can buy these pain medicines at the store. Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart.
166	Diagnosis of dry eye requires a comprehensive eye evaluation. Your eye care professional will ask you about your symptoms, your overall health (conditions for which you are treated, medications that you take), your eye history (use of contact lenses, past refractive or other eye surgery), and aspects of your daily environment (exposure to environmental allergens or occupational hazards). Clear Eyes¬Æ Pure Relief‚Ñ¢ for DRY EYES Glycerin / Lubricant Eye Drops 0.34 FL OZ (10 mL) for the temporary relief of burning and irritation due to dryness of the eye.¬†¬† for use as a protectant against further¬†irritation or dryness of the eye. He or she will test your vision, check your eye pressure, examine your eyelids and front eye structures, and if necessary may dilate the pupils to examine the inside of the eye. Your eye care professional may order a tearing test to find out if your eyes are producing enough tears to keep them moist. In one type of test, called a Schirmers test, the doctor may measure your tear production by placing strips of blotting paper under your lower eyelids, usually done after numbing the eye with anesthetic drops. After a few minutes, the doctor removes the strips and measures the amount of tear production. Murine Tears¬Æ For DRY EYES Lubricant Eye Drops Original Natural Tears Formula ? Moisture Enriched ?

169	Testicular torsion causes: Severe pain in one testicle and sometimes in the belly area Sudden swelling of the testicle Feeling sick and throwing up Fever Needing to urinate often There are a number of less common causes. Less common causes include A hernia in the groin (inguinal hernia) Infection of the testis (orchitis), usually caused by mumps or another virus Pain from a disorder in the abdomen (such as a kidney stone or appendicitis) Injury Dangerous disorders that sometimes cause scrotal pain include a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and necrotizing infection of the perineumthe area between the genitals and anuscalled Fournier gangrene. Cancer of a testis only rarely causes pain.
170	There is no cure for Angelman syndrome. Treatment helps to manage health and development problems caused by the condition. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15.The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Anticonvulsant medicines help control seizures Behavior therapy helps manage hyperactivity, sleep problems, and development problems Occupational and speech therapy manage speech problems and teach living skills Physical therapy helps with walking and movement problems Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic condition that causes problems with the way a child's body and brain develop. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood. Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as "coarse." Most individuals with Angelman syndrome will have severe developmental delays, speech limitations, and motor difficulties. However, individuals with Angelman syndrome can have normal life spans and generally do not show developmental regression as they age. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions and therapies help improve quality of life. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene.
174	Scabies is an itchy skin condition caused by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabei. Several lotions are available to treat scabies. Crusted scabies may be particularly difficult to treat. Patients with crusted scabies may be instructed by their doctors to remove scaling skin so that topical medications can penetrate the skin more easily.[3] Repeated applications of a topical medication or combined treatment with a topical and an oral medication for several weeks or longer may be necessary.[3][4] Patients who still have signs of infection after one month may need additional treatment. Infants and pregnant women should be treated for scabies only if the benefit is determined to outweigh the risk and if the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy .[3] A dermatologist or infectious disease physician should be involved in the care of the patient and those with whom they have had close contact. Treatment of crusted scabies should be done in an inpatient or residential setting, with the patient in a private room. Treatment includes oral Ivermectin and topical insecticides. Crusted scabies (also called Norwegian scabies) is an infestation characterized by thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs. It is a severe form of scabies that occurs most often in people who have a weakened immune system or a neurological disease, the elderly, and the disabled. The symptoms of the more common form of scabies, such as itching and a rash, may be absent. Crusted scabies is very contagious and can spread both by direct skin-to-skin contact and through contaminated items such as clothing, bedding, and furniture.[1][2] It is caused by super-infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis, a mite that can only reproduce on humans. The infected person's clothes, bedding and towels should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. People with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent future outbreaks of scabies.[1] Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic infections, is commonly used for treatment.[2] Scabies is an itchy rash. It's caused by tiny insects called mites. The mites get into your skin and lay eggs The mites spread easily to other people through physical contact The rash itches very badly Doctors treat scabies with a medicated cream Treatment is also recommended for household members and sexual partners. Scabies spreads quickly in crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people. Hospitals, child-care centers, and nursing homes are examples. This can happen much more easily when the infested person has crusted scabies. You cannot get scabies from a pet. Pets get a different mite infection called mange. Symptoms are - Pimple-like irritations or a rash - Intense itching, especially at night - Sores caused by scratching Your health care provider diagnoses scabies by looking at the skin rash and finding burrows in the skin.
175	If there's a health problem causing your hair loss, doctors treat that problem. They also treat hair loss with: Medicine for male and female pattern baldness, which can take 8 to 12 months to work Hair transplants to move hair follicles from a hairy area of your scalp to your bald area Wigs Wigs often offer the best treatment for temporary hair loss (for example, that caused by chemotherapy). Treatment for hair loss depends on the cause. In some cases, treating the underlying cause will correct the problem. Other treatments include medicines and hair restoration. People undergoing chemotherapy should consult a wig maker even before therapy begins so that an appropriate wig can be ready when needed. When hair regrows, it may be different in color and texture from the original hair. Summary You lose up to 100 hairs from your scalp every day. That's normal, and in most people, those hairs grow back. But many men -- and some women -- lose hair as they grow older. You can also lose your hair if you have certain diseases, such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or lupus. If you take certain medicines or have chemotherapy for cancer, you may also lose your hair. Other causes are stress, a low protein diet, a family history, or poor nutrition.
176	Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina‚Äîwhich is the light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of side (peripheral)¬†vision. Learn more orphan products. National Library of Medicine Drug Information Portal Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes cells in the retina to die, causing progressive vision loss. The first sign of RP usually is night blindness. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), and eventually loss of central vision. RP may be caused by mutations in any of at least 50 genes . Inheritance can be autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , or X-linked .[1] Treatment options to slow the progression of vision loss include light avoidance, use of low-vision aids, and vitamin A supplementation. Researchers are working to develop new treatment options for the future such as gene therapy , stem cell transplantation and prosthetic implants.[2][3] Vitamin A palmitate Omega-3 fatty acid supplements Lutein plus zeaxanthin supplements Sometimes, drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Sometimes, surgically implanted computer chips No treatment can reverse the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptors and other cell¬†types Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. Vitamin A palmitate may help slow the progression of the disorder in some people. Supplements with an omega-3 fatty acid (for example, docosahexaenoic acid) and a combination of lutein plus zeaxanthin may also slow the rate of vision loss. People who have swelling of the retina (macular edema), drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (usually acetazolamide or dorzolamide) are given by mouth or as eye drops. A new gene-therapy drug called voretigene neparovovec-ryzl may restore some vision to people with a particular mutation, provided they still have some retinal cells capable of surviving and reproducing. People who have lost all vision or almost all vision can be given a surgically implanted computer chip in the eye, which can restore some perception of light and shapes. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option. However, taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease appear to be relatively weak.[4] Studies have explored potential treatment with DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish. While DHA is known to play a structural role in retinal cells , more research is needed to determine whether supplements should be recommended.[2] Current research is focused on the development of new treatments including gene therapy , retinal transplantation, and the use of a retinal prosthesis. Stem cell transplantation would involve the injection and integration of stem cells into the retina, in hopes these cells will replace dead cells and provide the missing enzymes and chemicals needed for sight. Gene therapy could potentially be used when the disease-causing mutation is known and would aim to restore production of the missing or abnormal protein . Studies with retinal prosthetics have tested devices that transform light into electrical signals that can be sent directly to the inner retina and brain, avoiding the diseased part of the outer retina. Though challenges remain, preliminary research into these technologies has been promising.[2][3] FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition.
178	Leg pain can be due to a muscle cramp (also called a charley horse). Common causes of cramps include: Dehydration or low amounts of potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium in the blood Medicines (such as diuretics and statins) Muscle fatigue or strain from overuse, too much exercise, or holding a muscle in the same position for a long time An injury can also cause leg pain from: A torn or overstretched muscle (strain) Hairline crack in the bone (stress fracture) Salt tablets or sports drinks, which also replenish lost minerals, can be helpful. Other tips for relieving muscle cramps: - Change your workouts so that you are exercising within your ability. - Drink plenty of fluids while exercising and increase your potassium intake (orange juice and bananas are great sources of potassium). Leg cramps are common. The most common causes are benign leg cramps and exercise-associated cramping. Stretching and not consuming caffeine can help prevent muscle cramps. Drug therapy is not usually recommended to prevent muscle cramps. Some disorders cause symptoms that resemble muscle cramps. Dystonias are involuntary muscle contractions, but they usually last longer and occur more often than cramps. Inflamed tendon (tendinitis) Shin splints (pain in the front of the leg from overuse) This pain is due to inadequate blood flow to muscles, not to muscle contraction as occurs with cramps. Also, they tend to affect other muscles and may affect many other muscles, including any limb muscles as well as those of the back, neck, and voice. In contrast, benign leg cramps and exercise-associated muscle cramping tend to affect the calf muscles. Tetany is continuous or periodic spasms of muscles throughout the body. Illusory muscle cramps occur in some people. These people feel as if they are having cramps but no muscle contraction occurs. Hardening of the arteries in the legs (peripheral arterial disease) may cause calf pain (claudication) during physical activity such as walking. Other common causes of leg pain include: Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which causes a problem with blood flow in the legs (this type of pain, called claudication, is generally felt when exercising or walking and is relieved by rest) Blood clot (deep vein thrombosis) from long-term bed rest Infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or skin and soft tissue (cellulitis) Inflammation of the leg joints caused by arthritis or gout Nerve damage common to people with diabetes, smokers, and alcoholics Varicose veins Less common causes include: Cancerous bone tumors (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma) Legg-Calve-Perthes disease: Poor blood flow to the hip that may stop or slow the normal growth of the leg Noncancerous (benign) tumors or cysts of the femur or tibia (osteoid osteoma) Sciatic nerve pain (radiating pain down the leg) caused by a slipped disk in the back Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: Most often seen in boys and overweight children between ages 11 and 15 If you have a muscle cramp, stop your activity and try stretching and massaging the muscle. Heat will relax the muscle when the spasm begins, but ice may be helpful when the pain has improved. If the muscle is still sore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can help with pain. If the muscle cramps are severe, your health care provider can prescribe other medicines. The most common cause of muscle cramps during sports activity is not getting enough fluids.
180	Causes of colitis include: Infections caused by a virus or a parasite Food poisoning due to bacteria Crohn disease Ulcerative colitis Lack of blood flow (ischemic colitis) Past radiation to the large bowel (radiation colitis and strictures) Necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns Pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection Stool tests A doctor usually suspects hemorrhagic colitis when a person has bloody diarrhea. To make the diagnosis of hemorrhagic colitis, a doctor has stool specimens tested for strains of E. coli or the toxins they produce. Other studies that can identify colitis include: CT scan of the abdomen MRI of the abdomen Barium enema Stool culture Stool examination for ova and parasites How often do you have diarrhea? Ulcerative colitis can usually be controlled with medicines. A health care provider diagnoses ulcerative colitis with the following:medical and family history physical exam lab tests endoscopies of the large intestineThe health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease, that may cause symptoms similar to those of ulcerative colitis. Medical and Family HistoryTaking a medical and family history can help the health care provider diagnose ulcerative colitis and understand a patient's symptoms. Endoscopies of the Large IntestineEndoscopies of the large intestine are the most accurate methods for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and ruling out other possible conditions, such as Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or cancer. The health care provider will also ask the patient about current and past medical conditions and medications. Physical ExamA physical exam may help diagnose ulcerative colitis. If the health care provider suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. During a physical exam, the health care provider most oftenchecks for abdominal distension, or swelling listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and painLab TestsA health care provider may order lab tests to help diagnose ulcerative colitis, including blood and stool tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. People with ulcerative colitis may be more likely to develop colon cancer whenulcerative colitis affects the entire colon a person has ulcerative colitis for at least 8 years inflammation is ongoing people also have primary sclerosing cholangitis, a condition that affects the liver a person is malePeople who receive ongoing treatment and remain in remission may reduce their chances of developing colon cancer. People with ulcerative colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. Screening can include colonoscopy with biopsies or a special dye spray called chromoendoscopy. Health care providers may recommend colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years for people with ulcerative colitis who havethe disease in one-third or more or of their colon had ulcerative colitis for 8 yearsSuch screening does not reduce a person's chances of developing colon cancer. Instead, screening can help diagnose cancer early and improve chances for recovery. Viral, bacterial and parasitic colitis can be cured with appropriate medicines. Pseudomembranous colitis can usually be cured with appropriate antibiotics. Computed tomography (CT) or sometimes colonoscopy A doctor may suspect ischemic colitis on the basis of the symptoms of pain and bleeding, especially in a person older than 60. It is important for doctors to distinguish ischemic colitis from acute mesenteric ischemia, a more dangerous condition in which blood flow to part of the intestine is completely and irreversibly blocked. Doctors usually do CT or sometimes also colonoscopy (examination of the large intestine with a flexible viewing tube) to distinguish ischemic colitis from other forms of inflammation, such as infection or inflammatory bowel disease. Most of the times, the cause of colitis is not known.
181	The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection. Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called "referred" pain. Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term ear infection Long-term ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection. Other causes may include: Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear An earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain in one or both ears. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. The pain may last a short time or be ongoing. Related conditions include: Otitis media Swimmer's ear Malignant otitis externa A tension headache: - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for a similar period of time. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. - Tends to be on both sides of your head.
182	Knee for a seriously knee damage, which can include: Knee replacement. Arthritis in Knees The most common type of arthritis of the knee is osteoarthritis. Knee for a seriously knee damage, which can include: Knee replacement. Arthritis in Knees The most common type of arthritis of the knee is osteoarthritis. Knee for a seriously knee damage, which can include: Knee replacement. A knee sprain is a tear in one or more of the ligaments that hold your knee in place. Holding the Knee Together The collateral ligaments, one on either side of the knee, prevent the knee from moving from side to side too much. The cruciate ligaments inside the joint prevent the knee from moving forward or backward too much. The menisci are cartilage "shock absorber pads" between the thighbone (femur) and larger lower leg bone (tibia), which form part of the knee joint. Thorough treatment of fungal infections elsewhere in the body may help prevent fungal arthritis. Studies of the various forms of arthritis are helping doctors better understand these diseases and develop treatments to stop or slow their progression and damage to joints, including the knees. Studies of the various forms of arthritis are helping doctors better understand these diseases and develop treatments to stop or slow their progression and damage to joints, including the knees. Other areas of research involve trying to understand better how and why joint injuries occur and the measures that should be taken to prevent them, investigating the role of exercise in protecting the knee, and developing less invasive surgeries and better joint prostheses.

183	A Bartholin abscess forms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. Fluid in the gland builds up and may become infected. In other cases, it may need to be done in the hospital with general anesthesia so that you are asleep and pain-free. DRAINAGE OF THE ABSCESSA small surgical cut can completely drain the abscess. This relieves symptoms and provides the fastest recovery. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia in a provider's office. A 1 to 2 cm cut is made at the site of abscess. A catheter (tube) may be inserted and left in place for 4 to 6 weeks. This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling. Drained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed. Fluid may build up over many years before an abscess occurs. Surgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with medicine to make you sleepy. Surgery is most often an outpatient procedure, which means that you go home on the same day. The surgeon cuts open the abscess and drains the pus. Sometimes a drain is put in to keep the incision open and draining, and sometimes the abscess cavity is packed with gauze. If the pus collection is deep, you may need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the abscess drainage site. After surgery, you may need warm sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water). The chance of a full recovery is excellent. The abscesses may return in few cases. Often the abscess appears quickly over several days. It is important to treat any vaginal infection that is diagnosed at the same time as the abscess. Activity that puts pressure on the vulva, and walking and sitting, may cause severe pain. Bartholin abscess is the buildup of pus that forms a lump (swelling) in one of the Bartholin glands. SELF-CARE STEPSSoaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. This allows continuous drainage while the area heals.
184	Gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) insertion is done in part using a procedure called endoscopy. This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end of it. Your provider should also tell you when you need to have a wound checked and the stitches removed. Then, you can start to gently wash around the site 1 to 2 times daily. Wash with cool water and soap. Clean as close to the stitches as you can. Do not wash or rub the stitches directly. Dab the site dry with a clean paper towel. Do not rub the area. Avoid using the towel directly on the stitches. A gastrostomy feeding tube insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall. It goes directly into the stomach. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. After the endoscopy tube is inserted, the skin over the left side of belly (abdomen) area is cleaned and numbed. The doctor makes a small surgical cut in this area. The G-tube is inserted through this cut into the stomach. The tube is small, flexible, and hollow. The doctor uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube. Stitches are special threads that are sewn through the skin at an injury site to bring a wound together. Care for your stitches and wound as follows: Keep the area clean and dry for the first 24 to 48 hours after stitches have been placed.
185	Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain. The painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a type of chronic pain that affects your face. It causes extreme, sudden burning or shock-like pain. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain. Any vibration on your face, even from talking, can set it off. The condition may come and go, disappearing for days or even months. But the longer you have it, the less often it goes away. TN usually affects people over 50, especially women. The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown. There is no single test to diagnose TN. The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. The pain of TN comes from the trigeminal nerve. This nerve carries the sensations of touch and pain from the face, eyes, sinuses, and mouth to the brain. Trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by: Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering myelin of the nerves Pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or tumor Injury to the trigeminal nerve, such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery Often, no exact cause is found. TN usually affects adults above age 50 years, but it can occur at any age. When TN affects people younger than 40, it is often due to MS or a tumor. TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation.
188	If untreated, hypothyroidism can eventually cause anemia, a low body temperature, and heart failure. This situation may progress to confusion, stupor, or coma (myxedema coma). More information about diet and nutrition can be found on the National Agricultural Library website at www.nutrition.gov. Tips for talking with health care providers are available through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Dietary Supplements Iodine is an essential mineral for the thyroid. However, people with autoimmune thyroid disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Taking iodine drops or eating foods containing large amounts of iodinesuch as seaweed, dulse, or kelpmay cause or worsen hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. More information about iodine can be found in the National Library of Medicine fact sheet Iodine in diet, available at www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002421.htm. Women need more iodine when they are pregnantabout 250 micrograms a day because the baby gets iodine from the mothers diet. In the United States, about 7 percent of pregnant women may not get enough iodine in their diet or through prenatal vitamins.3 Choosing iodized salt salt supplemented with iodineover plain salt and prenatal vitamins containing iodine will ensure this need is met. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of dietary supplements, such as iodine, with their health care provider. Because symptoms in older people can be different, are often subtle and vague, and are common among older people who do not have hypothyroidism, doctors may not recognize these symptoms as being caused by hypothyroidism. Doctors treat hypothyroidism with: Thyroid hormone pills After you start the pills, your doctor will gradually adjust the dose based on your TSH level. It's important to talk to your doctor about medicines that interfere with absorbing thyroid hormone. Such medicines include iron, calcium, and some antacids. A screening test, in which blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone are measured, is important. The test should be done at age 65 even if people have no symptoms of hypothyroidism. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening complication in which breathing slows, seizures occur, and blood flow to the brain decreases. Myxedema coma can be triggered in a person with hypothyroidism by physical stresses, such as exposure to the cold, as well as by an infection, injury, surgery, and drugs such as sedatives that depress brain function. When such symptoms do occur among older people, they are less obvious. Older people may also have less typical symptoms. For example, they may lose weight, become confused, and have a decreased appetite, joint stiffness, joint and muscle pains, weakness, and a tendency to fall.
190	Summary Usher syndrome is an inherited disease that causes serious hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disorder that causes your vision to get worse over time. Usher syndrome type II is characterized by hearing loss from birth and progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. The hearing loss associated with this form of Usher syndrome ranges from mild to severe and mainly affects high tones. Unlike other forms of Usher syndrome, people with type II do not have difficulties with balance caused by inner ear problems. Unlike the other forms of Usher syndrome, infants with Usher syndrome type III are usually born with normal hearing. So far, 11 genetic loci (a segment of chromosome on which a certain gene is located) have been found to cause Usher syndrome, and nine genes have been pinpointed that cause the disorder. There are three types of Usher syndrome: People with type I are deaf from birth and have severe balance problems from a young age. They¬†are: - Type 1 Usher syndrome: MY07A, USH1C, CDH23, PCHD15,¬†SANS - Type 2 Usher syndrome: USH2A, VLGR1,¬†WHRN - Type 3 Usher syndrome: USH3A With so many possible genes involved in Usher syndrome, genetic tests for the disorder are not conducted on a widespread basis. To learn about laboratories that conduct clinical testing, visit the Web site www.GeneTests.org and search the laboratory directory by typing in the term Usher syndrome. Genetic testing for additional Usher syndrome genes may be available through clinical research studies. To learn about clinical trials that include genetic testing for Usher syndrome, visit the Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov and type in the search term Usher syndrome or Usher genetic¬†testing. Because Usher syndrome affects hearing, balance, and vision, diagnosis of the disorder usually includes the evaluation of all three senses. The earlier that parents know if their child has Usher syndrome, the sooner that child can begin special educational training programs to manage the loss of hearing and¬†vision. If both parents are carriers of a mutated gene for Usher syndrome, they will have a one-in-four chance of having a child with Usher syndrome with each¬†birth. Usually, parents who have normal hearing and vision do not know if they are carriers of an Usher syndrome gene mutation. The term autosomal means that the mutated gene is not located on either of the chromosomes that determine a person‚Äôs sex; in other words, both males and females can have the disorder and can pass along the disorder to a child. The word recessive means that to have Usher syndrome, an individual must receive a mutated form of the Usher syndrome gene from each parent. Usher syndrome are born with moderate to severe hearing loss and normal balance. The visual problems in type 2 Usher syndrome tend to progress more slowly than those in type 1, with the onset of retinitis pigmentosa often not apparent until the¬†teens. A person with type 3 Usher syndrome may develop hearing loss by the teens, and he or she will usually require hearing aids by mid- to late adulthood. Vision problems start in the early teens and get worse more slowly than in type I. People with type III are born with normal hearing and near-normal balance but develop vision problems and then hearing loss. Intervention should be introduced early, during the first few years of life, so that the child can take advantage of the unique window of time during which the brain is most receptive to learning language, whether spoken or signed. The major symptoms of Usher syndrome are hearing loss and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, or RP. As retinitis pigmentosa progresses, the field of vision narrows, a condition known as ‚Äútunnel vision,‚Äù until only central vision (the ability to see straight ahead) remains. The optic nerve (arrow) looks very pale, the vessels (stars) are very thin and there is characteristic pigment, called bone spicules (double¬†arrows).
191	Other treatment will depend on how bad the condition is. Choose soft foods and avoid nuts, chips, and other crunchy foods if you have sores in your mouth. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of disorders in which skin blisters form after a minor injury. It is passed down in families. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Additionally, a buildup of granulation tissue in the airway can lead to a weak, hoarse cry and difficulty breathing. Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion of the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Because the signs and symptoms of Herlitz JEB are so severe, infants with this condition usually do not survive beyond the first year of life. The milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa is called non-Herlitz JEB. The blistering associated with non-Herlitz JEB may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows, and it often improves after the newborn period. Researchers classify junctional epidermolysis bullosa into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. HOME CAREFollow these guidelines at home: Take good care of your skin to prevent infections. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. Granulation tissue bleeds easily and profusely, making affected infants susceptible to serious infections and loss of necessary proteins, minerals, and fluids. Follow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw. You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or dressing, and if so, what type to use. You may need to use oral steroid medicines for short periods of time if you have swallowing problems. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat. Take good care of your oral health and get regular dental check-ups. It is best to see a dentist who has experience treating people with EB.
192	Blinding (preventing research subjects and practitioners from knowing which people were given which treatment) is challenging in acupuncture studies. Occasionally, needles are mistakenly left in place after acupuncture is completed; equipment counting, similar to that conducted after surgical procedures, makes this less likely. Acupuncture may cause bruising or bleeding in people who have severe bleeding disorders or who take blood-thinning drugs. Nurse educators, who help you understand your condition and help start treatment plans. Licensed acupuncture therapists, who reduce pain and improve physical functioning by inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. So-called "sham" acupuncture (insertion of needles at points other than those used in acupuncture) often puts pressure on acupressure points, making measuring acupuncture effects difficult. Nurse educators, who help you understand your condition and help start treatment plans. Licensed acupuncture therapists, who reduce pain and improve physical functioning by inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. If NSAIDs do not relieve symptoms of your childs juvenile arthritis, the doctor may prescribe this type of medication.

Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. If NSAIDs do not relieve symptoms of your childs juvenile arthritis, the doctor may prescribe this type of medication. If your childs medications or form of arthritis can affect the eyes, catching problems early can help keep them from becoming serious. All children with juvenile arthritis need to have regular exams by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to detect eye inflammation. If your childs medications or form of arthritis can affect the eyes, catching problems early can help keep them from becoming serious. All children with juvenile arthritis need to have regular exams by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to detect eye inflammation. Thorough brushing and flossing of the teeth can be difficult if your childs hands are affected by arthritis. Comparing acupuncture to the control practice of sham acupuncture is complicated because the comparison therapy is still a relaxation practice with a provider. The placebo for acupuncture may involve using opaque sheaths containing a blunt needle or toothpick that is pressed against the skin but is not inserted, though this would still put pressure on acupuncture points. Many academic medical centers and healthcare organizations, including the World Health Organization, continue to investigate and explore the efficacy of acupuncture. Side effects of acupuncture are usually mild if the technique is done correctly, but the following should be noted: Temporary worsening of symptoms may occur.
194	How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly. Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible: Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs. The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. Scoliosis treatment may also include: Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace. Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly. In more severe cases, treatment should be started as early as possible and may include: A brace to try to keep the spine straight Physical therapy to keep scoliosis from getting worse Surgery to join backbones together Your child may feel badly about having scoliosis or be upset about the treatment. The more severe the curve, the greater the likelihood of it worsening, and curves tend to worsen in the early stages of puberty when growth is accelerated. Likewise, the more symptoms that develop, the greater the likelihood that scoliosis will worsen. Worsening scoliosis may eventually cause permanent problems, such as noticeable deformities or chronic pain. Severe scoliosis may even affect internal organsfor example, deforming and damaging the lungs. Scoliosis that causes symptoms, is worsening, or is severe may need to be treated. The earlier treatment is begun, the better the chance of preventing a severe deformity. Mild scoliosis usually causes no symptoms. Sometimes the back becomes sore or stiff after the child sits or stands for a long period of time. Mild scoliosis may be discovered during a routine physical examination. A parent, teacher, or doctor may suspect scoliosis when one of the childs shoulders seems higher than the other or when the childs clothes do not hang straight. But sometimes children have: One shoulder higher than the other One hip higher than the other causing an uneven waist Mild to severe back pain Severe scoliosis can cause: Constant pain Difficulty breathing, if the rib cage presses on the lungs Damage to internal organs Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone, or spine. Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early teens, when children grow fast. Doctors use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to diagnose scoliosis. Treatment depends on your age, how much more you're likely to grow, how much curving there is, and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Often, the goal of surgery is simply to allow a child to be able to sit upright in a wheelchair. Congenital scoliosis is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries. Treatment depends on many things: The cause of scoliosis Where the curve is in your spine How big the curve is If your body is still growing Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment.
195	Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints. A joint is the area where two bones meet. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis usually comes with age and most often affects the fingers, knees, and hips. For example, you might have badly injured your knee when young and develop arthritis in your knee joint years later. There are over 100 different types of arthritis. Gout is caused by crystals that build up in the joints. It usually affects the big toe, but many other joints may be affected. Juvenile Arthritis is the term used to describe arthritis in children. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis usually comes with age and most often affects the fingers, knees, and hips. For example, you might have badly injured your knee when young and develop arthritis in your knee joint years later. Juvenile Arthritis is the term used to describe arthritis in children.
197	Treatment depends on the cause and is aimed at relieving symptoms and ensuring the body receives enough nutrients. A high-calorie diet may be tried. Malabsorption involves problems with the body's ability to take in nutrients from food. Treatment depends on the cause. Some malabsorption diseases have specific treatments. For example, tropical sprue and Whipple disease are treated with antibiotics. In general, if you have trouble with only certain foods, doctors will have you avoid them. If you are missing certain digestive enzymes, sometimes you can take enzyme supplements. You may need to take extra vitamins and nutrients. So malabsorption means bad absorption. It should supply: Key vitamins and minerals, such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 Enough carbohydrates, proteins, and fats If needed, injections of some vitamins and minerals or special growth factors will be given. A problem somewhere in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract keeps you from absorbing one or more kinds of nutrients. Malabsorption can be caused by diseases, surgery on your intestines, or intestinal infections You'll usually lose weight and have diarrhea and smelly stool (poop) After a while, you may get vitamin deficiencies, which may give you a low blood count and feel make you feel sick Doctors often have to do stool and blood tests and sometimes look in your stomach and intestines with a flexible scope (endoscopy) Different causes of malabsorption need different treatments, but doctors usually try to adjust your diet to relieve your symptoms Many diseases can cause malabsorption. Most often, malabsorption involves problems absorbing certain sugars, fats, proteins, or vitamins. It can also involve an overall problem with absorbing food. Problems or damage to the small intestine that may lead to problems absorbing important nutrients. A decrease of these enzymes makes it harder to absorb fats and certain nutrients. Problems with the pancreas may be caused by: Cystic fibrosis Infections or swelling of the pancreas Trauma to the pancreas Surgery to remove part of the pancreas Some of the other causes of malabsorption include: AIDS and HIV Certain medicines (tetracycline, some antacids, some medicines used to treat obesity, colchicine, acarbose, phenytoin, cholestyramine) Gastrectomy and surgical treatments for obesity Cholestasis Chronic liver disease Cow's milk protein intolerance Soy milk protein intolerance Those with damage to the pancreas may need to take pancreatic enzymes. Medicines to slow down the normal movement of the intestine can be tried. This may allow food to remain in the intestine longer. If the body is not able to absorb enough nutrients, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is tried. It will help you or your child get nutrition from a special formula through a vein in the body. Your provider will select the right amount of calories and TPN solution.
202	The outcome is often good if you have surgery to repair the aneurysm before it ruptures. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm begins to tear or ruptures, it is a medical emergency. "[3] Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and may include blood pressure medications, or surgery to repair the aneurysm.[1] If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms: Surgery is rarely done. This may be a safer approach if you have certain other medical problems or are an older adult. Endovascular repair can sometimes be done for a leaking or bleeding aneurysm. You and your provider must decide if the risk of having surgery is smaller than the risk of bleeding if you do not have surgery. Your provider may want to check the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound tests every 6 months. The goal is to do surgery before complications develop. A large cut is made in your abdomen. The abnormal vessel is replaced with a graft made of man-made material. Endovascular stent grafting - This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. The exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or tear. The aorta is the main blood vessel (artery) that carries blood away from your heart to the rest of your body. An aneurysm is a bulge in an artery wall. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the part of your aorta that passes through your belly. Aneurysms may cause a pulsing feeling in your belly Aneurysms that are large or are growing need surgery to prevent them from bursting If the aneurysm bursts, blood flows out and you have severe pain and low blood pressure If the aneurysm bursts, you'll die if you don't have surgery Doctors often find an aneurysm during a regular exam or from an imaging test (such as an x-ray or CT scan) taken for another problem and found by accident You're more likely to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm if: You're a man You're between the ages of 50 and 80 Someone in your family had one You have high blood pressure You smoke The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the abdomen, pelvis, and legs. An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when an area of the aorta becomes very large or balloons out. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are aneurysms that occur in the part of the aorta that passes through the abdomen. They may occur at any age, but are most common in men between 50 and 80 years of age. The condition has multiple genetic and environmental risk factors , and may sometimes occur as part of an inherited syndrome . When more than one family member is affected, it may be considered " familial abdominal aortic aneurysm.
203	Avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages, even if your pancreatitis is mild. Other treatments may involve: Pain medicines or a surgical nerve block to relieve pain Taking insulin to control blood sugar (glucose) level Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment for acute or chronic pancreatitis may includea hospital stay to treat dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids and, if you can swallow them, fluids by mouth pain medicine, and antibiotics by mouth or through an IV if you have an infection in your pancreas a low-fat diet, or nutrition by feeding tube or IV if you can't eatYour doctor may send you to a gastroenterologist or surgeon for one of the following treatments, depending on the type of pancreatitis that you have. Mild acute pancreatitis usually goes away in a few days with rest and treatment. Doctors use ERCP to treat both acute and chronic pancreatitis. ERCP combines upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and x-rays to treat narrowing or blockage of a bile or pancreatic duct. Your gastroenterologist may use ERCP to remove gallstones blocking the bile or pancreatic ducts. Treatment for chronic pancreatitis may help relieve pain, improve how well the pancreas works, and manage complications. Your doctor may prescribe or provide the following:Medicines and vitamins. If your pancreatitis is more severe, your treatment may also include:Surgery. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy, if gallstones cause your pancreatitis. Having surgery within a few days after you are admitted to the hospital lowers the chance of complications. In severe cases, a part of or the entire pancreas may be removed. The tube may stay in for 1 to 2 days, or sometimes for 1 to 2 weeks. The right diet is important for people with chronic pancreatitis to keep a healthy weight and get the correct nutrients. A nutritionist can help you create a diet that includes: Drinking plenty of liquids Limiting fats Eating small, frequent meals (this helps reduce digestive symptoms) Getting enough vitamins and calcium in the diet, or as extra supplements Limiting caffeine The health care provider may prescribe pancreatic enzymes. The enzymes will help you digest food better, gain weight and reduce diarrhea.
204	With CPAP, people breathe through a face or nose mask connected to a device that provides a slightly higher pressure in the airway. Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea. These people may benefit from taking modafinil, which is a mild stimulant used to treat daytime sleepiness in people with obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is when your breathing slows or stops for a short time while you're sleeping and then restarts. People with sleep apnea usually snore loudly at night and are very tired during the day Doctors usually do a sleep study if they suspect sleep apnea Doctors may treat you with a breathing machine connected to a mask (CPAP machine), with a mouthpiece, or sometimes with surgery If you're not treated, you have an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease To treat obstructive sleep apnea, your doctor may: Give you a CPAP machine to help you breathe while you sleep Give you a mouthpiece that helps keep your airway open during sleep Sometimes do surgery on the back of your mouth to remove and reshape tissue Surgically place a device to help keep your airway open A CPAP machine pushes air into your throat through a mask. Other drugs are also being tested for people with obstructive sleep apnea. A dentist makes the mouthpiece specially to fit your mouth. Lose weight if you're overweight or obese Stop smoking Avoid drinking alcohol Avoid medicines that cause drowsiness before bed Sleep on your side or raise the head of your bed Sometimes, take medicine to help you stay awake during the day The pressurized air keeps your throat from closing. For example, drugs may be given to reduce the severity of heart failure. Oxygen delivered by nasal prongs (not under pressure) may reduce episodes of apnea in people whose levels of blood oxygen become low while sleeping. Some people with central sleep apnea may benefit from CPAP. People with central apnea of the Cheyne-Stokes type have fewer episodes of apnea and a lower severity of heart failure with this treatment but do not survive longer. Acetazolamide can help people who have central sleep apnea caused by high altitude and possibly even people at sea level. Some people benefit from surgery to implant a device that stimulates the diaphragm (a diaphragmatic/phrenic nerve stimulator) to help the person breathe. Heavy snorers and people who often choke in their sleep should not consume alcohol or take sleep aids, sedating antihistamines, or other drugs that cause drowsiness. Sleeping on the side or elevating the head of the bed can help reduce snoring. Special devices strapped on the back help prevent people from sleeping on their back. The various other devices and sprays marketed to reduce snoring may help simple snoring, but they have not been shown to relieve obstructive sleep apnea.
205	Follow your doctor's recommendation for treating the cause of the pain. For nonarthritis joint pain, both rest and exercise are important. The most common disorders outside the joints that cause pain around the joints include: Fibromyalgia Polymyalgia rheumatica Bursitis or tendinitis Warm baths, massage, and stretching exercises should be used as often as possible. Aceteminophen (Tylenol) may help the soreness feel better. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen or naproxen may help relieve pain and swelling. Talk to your health care provider before giving aspirin or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen to children. The causes for pain in many joints usually are different than those for pain in a single joint. Pain in many joints is usually caused by: Arthritis Arthritis is joint inflammation that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. The causes of the arthritis are different depending on whether the joints started hurting suddenly (acutely) or have been hurting for a long time (chronic).Sudden (acute) arthritis in more than one joint is most often caused by: Infection from a virus The start of a joint disorder or a flare up of a long-term joint disorder (such as rheumatoid arthritis) Less common causes include: Lyme disease Gonorrhea Streptococcal infections Reactive arthritis Gout Chronic arthritis in more than one joint is caused by: Inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus Osteoarthritis, which is the most common cause in older adults Autoimmune disorders Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (in children)
206	The doctor uses a special microscope to view the eye. The lens is removed in one of the following ways, depending on the type of cataract: Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery. If a person has other eye problems, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, the surgery may be more difficult or the outcome may not be as good. Before you go home, you may receive the following: A patch to wear over your eye until the follow-up exam Eyedrops to prevent infection, treat inflammation, and help with healing You will need to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually have a follow-up exam with your doctor the next day. If you had stitches, you will need to make an appointment to have them removed. Tips for recovering after cataract surgery: Wear dark sunglasses outside after you remove the patch. Wash your hands well before and after using eyedrops and touching your eye. Try not to get soap and water in your eye when you are bathing or showering for the first few days. Light activities are best as you recover. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving. Phacoemulsification: With this procedure, the doctor uses a tool that produces sound waves to break up the cataract into small pieces. Recovery takes about 2 weeks. If you need new glasses or contact lenses, you can usually have them fitted at that time. This procedure uses a very small incision. Extracapsular extraction: The doctor uses a small tool to remove the cataract in mostly one piece. Laser surgery: The doctor guides a machine that uses laser energy to make the incisions and soften the cataract. The rest of the surgery is much like phacoemulsification. Using the laser instead of a knife (scalpel) may speed recovery and be more accurate. After the cataract is removed, a manmade lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL), is usually placed into the eye to restore the focusing power of the old lens (cataract). If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor may suggest waiting at least 1 to 2 weeks between each surgery.
207	Symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome often include profound intellectual disability. Children may also have epilepsy, a broad or beaked nose, scalp defects, drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and gaps or fissures (colobomas) of the iris, cleft palate, and delayed bone development. Most affected children also have seizures, which may be resistant to treatment. Seizures tend to disappear with age. Additional features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome include skin changes such as mottled or dry skin, skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis), dental problems including missing teeth, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and/or in the lip (cleft lip). Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome can also cause abnormalities of the eyes, heart, genitourinary tract, and brain. A condition called Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome has features that overlap with those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Researchers now recognize that these two conditions are actually part of a single syndrome with variable signs and symptoms. People with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome experience delayed growth and development. They also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and underdeveloped muscles. Boys may have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and a misplaced opening of the urethra (hypospadias). Some children have an immune deficiency, which means their body is less able to fight off infections. Many affected children die during infancy. The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) for people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) depends on the specific features present and the severity of those features. The average life expectancy is unknown. Muscle weakness may increase the risk of having chest infections and ultimately may reduce the life expectancy. Many people, in the absence of severe heart defects, chest infections, and uncontrollable seizures , survive into adulthood.[3][4] Motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are significantly delayed. Intellectual disability ranges from mild to severe in people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.
210	Because dietary supplements are not regulated as drugs by the FDA, their manufacturers are not required to prove that supplements are safe and effective (although they must have a history of safety). He or she needs to know if you decide to use a dietary supplement. Talk with your doctor, your pharmacist, or a registered dietitian. Make sure any claim about a dietary supplement is based on scientific proof. The company making the dietary supplement should be able to send you information on the safety and/or effectiveness of the ingredients in a product, which you can then discuss with your doctor. A supplement that seemed to help your neighbor might not work for you. Could the writer or group profit from the sale of a particular supplement? A few private groups, such as the U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, ConsumerLab.com, and the Natural Products Association, have their own "seals of approval" for dietary supplements. To get such a seal, products must be made by following good manufacturing procedures, must contain what is listed on the label, and must not have harmful levels of ingredients that don't belong there, like lead. The same is true for over-the-counter drugs like pain and cold medicines. The Federal Government does not regularly test what is in dietary supplements, and companies are not required to share information on the safety of a dietary supplement with the FDA before they sell it. The companies are responsible for making sure the supplement is safe, but the FDA does not evaluate the safety of the product before the supplement is sold. So, just because you see a dietary supplement on a store shelf does not mean it is safe, that it does what the label says it will, or that it contains what the label says it contains. If the FDA receives reports of possible problems with a supplement, it will issue warnings about products that are clearly unsafe. The Federal Trade Commission looks into reports of ads that might misrepresent what dietary supplements do. Furthermore, because the need to evaluate supplements in humans has been recognized only recently, much of the available information has not been gathered systematically or scientifically and so is difficult to evaluate. Is a friend, a neighbor, or someone on a commercial suggesting you take one? Some ads for dietary supplements in magazines, online, or on TV seem to promise that these supplements will make you feel better, keep you from getting sick, or even help you live longer. Supplements may cost a lot, could be harmful, or simply might not be helpful. Some supplements can change how medicines you may already be taking will work. If your doctor recommends a dietary supplement for you, make sure you're getting the brand recommended by the doctor and that you take it as directed. Ask yourself why you think you might want to take a dietary supplement. However, a few supplements (for example, fish oil, chondroitin, glucosamine, St. John's wort) are proven to be safe and useful additions to standard drugs. In contrast, both prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs have been extensively and systematically studied by researchers and reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the FDA. These include studies in animals to detect the development of cancer and organ damage and studies in humans to detect any signs of toxicity.
211	Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later. The shingles vaccine is a safe and easy, one-time shot that may keep you from getting shingles. You should get the shot even if you have already had shingles or don't remember having chickenpox. However, if you have a weak immune system or allergies to certain medicines, make sure to check with your doctor first. You can get the shingles vaccine at your doctor's office and at some pharmacies. Preventing chickenpox by vaccinating children and adults who do not have immunity with the varicella vaccine is recommended. There are two shingles vaccines: a newer recombinant vaccine and an older, weakened live-virus vaccine. The recombinant vaccine is preferred and is recommended for healthy people aged 50 or over, regardless of whether they recall having had chickenpox or shingles and regardless of whether they have been vaccinated with the older shingles vaccine. The recombinant herpes zoster vaccine is given in two doses, injected into a muscle. The doses are given 2 to 6 months apart and at least 2 months after the older (weakened live-virus) vaccine for people who have had that vaccine. The recombinant vaccine significantly reduces the chance of getting shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. When shingles occurs, taking antiviral drugs may reduce the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia. The risk of getting shingles increases as you age. People may have a harder time fighting off infections as they get older. About half of all shingles cases are in adults age 60 or older. The chance of getting shingles becomes much greater by age 70. - Trouble fighting infections. It can cause burning, shooting pain, tingling, and/or itching, as well as a rash and blisters. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. In fact, most adults live with VZV in their bodies and never get shingles. Instead of causing another case of chickenpox, it produces shingles. A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait. A person should not get shingles vaccine who: - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital.
212	Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that affects certain white blood cells . People with this condition have immune systems that do not function properly, leaving the body vulnerable to chronic inflammation and frequent bacterial and fungal infections. Close relatives who have a similar tissue and blood types are the best donors. If they are willing to donate, they can be tested to determine whether their tissue and blood types are compatible with those of the affected person. Before transplantation, the person is given drugs to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) and thus help prevent rejection of the transplant. Symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear during early childhood but sometimes not until adolescence. Chronic infections occur in the skin, lungs, lymph nodes, mouth, nose, urinary tract, and intestines. Pockets of pus (abscesses) can develop around the anus and in the lungs and liver. The skin over the lymph nodes may break down and allow pus to drain. The features of this condition usually develop in infancy or early childhood; however, milder forms may be diagnosed in the teen years or even in adulthood.[1][2] Inflammation can occur in many different areas of the body in people with chronic granulomatous disease. In many cases the intestinal wall is inflamed, causing a form of inflammatory bowel disease that varies in severity but can lead to stomach pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, and vomiting. Other common areas of inflammation in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the stomach, colon, and rectum, as well as the mouth, throat, and skin. Rarely, people with chronic granulomatous disease develop autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. People with chronic granulomatous disease typically have at least one serious bacterial or fungal infection every 3 to 4 years. The lungs are the most frequent area of infection; pneumonia is a common feature of this condition. Individuals with chronic granulomatous disease may develop a type of fungal pneumonia, called mulch pneumonitis, which causes fever and shortness of breath after exposure to decaying organic materials such as mulch, hay, or dead leaves. Exposure to these organic materials and the numerous fungi involved in their decomposition causes people with chronic granulomatous disease to develop fungal infections in their lungs. It is caused by changes ( mutations ) in any one of five different genes and is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner.[3] Treatment consists of continuous therapy with antibiotic and antifungal medications to treat and prevent infections.[1][4] Other common areas of infection in people with chronic granulomatous disease include the skin, liver, and lymph nodes. The only cure for the disease is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).[5] Antibiotics and antifungal drugs to prevent and treat infections Interferon gamma Transfusions of granulocytes Stem cell transplantation Antibiotics, usually trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are given regularly and indefinitely to prevent infection. Antifungal drugs (such as itraconazole) are usually also given regularly to help prevent fungal infections. Interferon gamma (a drug that modifies the immune system), injected 3 times a week, can reduce the number and severity of infections. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell that includes some phagocytes. Stem cell transplantation has cured some people with chronic granulomatous disease.
213	Bell's palsy is a form of temporary facial paralysis which results from damage or trauma to one of the facial nerves. This disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paralysis that often affects just one side and can cause significant facial distortion. This nerve is called the facial orseventh cranial nerve. Damage to this nerve causes weakness or paralysis of these muscles. Paralysis means that you cannot use the muscles at all. Often, no treatment is needed. Symptoms often begin to improve right away. But, it may take weeks or even months for the muscles to get stronger. Your provider may give you lubricating eye drops or eye ointments to keep the surface of the eye moist if you can't close it completely. You may need to wear an eye patch while you sleep. Sometimes, medicines may be used, but it isn't known how much they help. If medicines are used, they are started right away. Symptoms vary, but may include twitching, weakness, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. Common medicines are: Corticosteroids, which may reduce swelling around the facial nerve Medicines such as valacyclovir to fight the virus that may be causing Bell palsy Surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve (decompression surgery) has not been shown to benefit most people with Bell palsy. Most people who have Bell palsy recover completely, without treatment, in several months Some people who have severe Bell palsy and can't move one side of their face at all may not recover fully If youve had symptoms for less than 48 hours, doctors may give you medicine called a corticosteroid that can make full recovery even more likely If you cannot close your eye all the way, your doctor may give you eye drops or a patch to protect your eye from drying out too much While the exact cause is unknown, many researchers believe that a virus may lead to swelling of the 7th cranial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone, may reduce the inflammation and swelling. Other medications used to treat Bell's palsy include acyclovir (to fight viral infections) and aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (to relieve pain). Physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture have also been used. Bell palsy is sudden weakness on one side of your face. It happens when a nerve in your face (called the facial nerve) swells and gets squeezed. Bell palsy affects only one side of your face That side of your face becomes weak and droops Treatment usually involves medicine called corticosteroids Most people with Bell palsy get better within several months, even without treatment Bell's palsy is a disorder of the nerve that controls movement of the muscles in the face.
215	The effectiveness of Ritalin LA for long-term use, i.e., for more than 2 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Ritalin LA for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). General information about RITALIN ¬Æ Do not use RITALIN ¬Æ for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Ritalin should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued. Tablets: Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. SR Tablets: Ritalin-SR tablets have a duration of action of approximately 8 hours. Therefore, Ritalin-SR tablets may be used in place of Ritalin tablets when the 8-hour dosage of Ritalin-SR corresponds to the titrated 8-hour dosage of Ritalin. Ritalin-SR tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. Ritalin should be periodically discontinued to assess the child‚Äôs condition. Pharmacodynamics Ritalin is a mild central nervous system stimulant. The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but Ritalin presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours (1.3-8.2 hours) for the SR tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3-4.4 hours) for the tablets. An average of 67% of SR tablet dose was excreted in children as compared to 86% in adults. There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system. Effects on QT Interval The effect of Focalin¬Æ XR (dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of Ritalin) on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of Focalin¬Æ XR 40mg in 75 healthy volunteers. Frederica‚Äôs method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was &lt;5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. are taking or have taken within the past 14 days an anti-depression medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor or MAOI. Relative bioavailability of the SR tablet compared to the Ritalin tablet, measured by the urinary excretion of Ritalin major metabolite (?-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid) was 105% (49%-168%) in children and 101% (85%-152%) in adults. are allergic to anything in RITALIN¬Æ. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients. RITALIN ¬Æ should not be used in children less than 6 years old because it has not been studied in this age group. What are possible side effects of RITALIN ¬Æ ? Keep RITALIN ¬Æ and all medicines out of the reach of children.
217	Doctors may suggest ways to help ease symptoms and prevent other problems: If your foot is numb, wear shoes and socks that fit well and check for pebbles or other things in your shoes before putting them on Check your numb area for sores, redness, or swelling If your hand is numb, be careful when touching things that may be hot or sharp If you have problems walking, getting physical therapy or using a cane or walker may help you walk safely and prevent falls Talk with your doctor about whether it's safe for you to drive. The condition causing numbness is corrected or treated when possible. General measures can help relieve symptoms and prevent additional problems. Precautions to prevent injury are needed because people with numbness are less likely to feel discomfort. If hands or fingers are numb, people should be careful when handling objects that could be hot or sharp. If people are having difficulty walking or have lost their sense of position (where body parts are), physical therapy can help them learn to walk more safely and to prevent falls. Your health care provider should find and treat the cause of your numbness or tingling. Other tests depending on the disorder suspected Demyelinating disorders (disorders that cause nerves to become inflamed and lose their outer layer, called the myelin sheath), such as Multiple sclerosis Often weakness or clumsiness and abnormal sensations (such as tingling or numbness) Both sides, mainly in the hands and feet: Simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body (a polyneuropathy) What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause and the tests that may need to be done (see table Some Causes and Features of Numbness).Doctors ask the person to describe the numbness. Then doctors may ask specific questions: When numbness began How quickly it began Whether the person also has other symptoms such as abnormal sensations, weakness or paralysis, loss of bowel or bladder control, retention of urine, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, or deterioration of mental function Whether any event, such as pressure on a limb, an injury, sleeping in an awkward position, or an infection, triggered the symptoms Knowing how quickly numbness and other symptoms began helps doctors determine the type of disorder. For example, back and/or neck pain suggests osteoarthritis, a ruptured disk, or another disorder that puts pressure on the spinal cord. Doctors also ask whether the person has had a disorder that can cause numbness, particularly diabetes, chronic kidney disease, infections (such as HIV infection or Lyme disease), a stroke, or arthritis. Numbness results when one part of the pathway for sensation malfunctions, usually because of a disorder or drug. With numbness, you may not be able to: Feel a light touch Sense pain Tell hot from cold Sense vibration Know the position of the numb part of your body Along with numbness, you may also have: Tingling or a pins-and-needles feeling Weakness Paralysis (trouble moving part of your body) When you touch something with your hand, the nerves in your hand send messages to your brain. For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or low back pain, your doctor may recommend certain exercises. Many different disorders and medicines can block or put pressure on this path, such as: Stroke Infection, such as Lyme disease or HIV Multiple sclerosis Diabetes Not having enough vitamin B12 in your body Osteoarthritis that presses on the nerves coming out of the spinal cord Pressure on a nerve from repeated motions or sitting in one position too long Injury to the brain, spinal cord or nerves Some people get numbness and tingling in their hands and around their mouth when they feel anxious and breathe too fast (hyperventilation). Numbness refers to partial or complete loss of sensation and is often accompanied by abnormal sensations, such as tingling. Numbness, which has many causes, occurs when one part of the pathway from sensory receptors in the skin to the brain malfunctions. Telling doctors which parts of the body are affected and how quickly symptoms develop helps doctors identify the location and cause of the malfunction. Testing usually starts with nerve conduction studies and electromyography if the sensory nerves, plexuses, or spinal nerve roots are thought to be affected or with MRI if the brain or spinal cord is thought to be affected. Medicines that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or changed. DO NOT change or stop taking any of your medicines or take large doses of any vitamins or supplements until you have talked with your provider. Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand or foot.
219	Your doctor may suggest you try the following: Pelvic muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises) work the muscles that you use to stop urinating. When timed voiding is combined with biofeedback and pelvic muscle exercises, you may find it easier to control urge and overflow incontinence. Besides bladder control training, you may want to talk with your doctor about other ways to help manage incontinence:- Medicines can help the bladder empty more fully during urination. Other drugs tighten muscles and can lessen leakage. - Surgery can sometimes improve or cure incontinence if it's caused by a change in the position of the bladder or blockage due to an enlarged prostate. Even after treatment, some people still leak urine from time to time. There are bladder control products and other solutions, including adult diapers, furniture pads, urine deodorizing pills, and special skin cleansers that may make leaking urine bother you a little less. Visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for more information on urinary incontinence in men and urinary incontinence in women. Read about this topic in Spanish. Lea sobre este tema en espanol. - Some women find that using an estrogen vaginal cream may help relieve stress or urge incontinence. A low dose of estrogen cream is applied directly to the vaginal walls and urethral tissue. Lifestyle changes may help with incontinence. Losing weight, quitting smoking, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to alcohol, drinking less caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and many sodas), preventing constipation and avoiding lifting heavy objects may help with incontinence. Choosing water instead of other drinks and limiting drinks before bedtime may also help. Making these muscles stronger helps you hold urine in your bladder longer. Biofeedback uses sensors to make you aware of signals from your body. Timed voiding may help you control your bladder. In timed voiding, you urinate on a set schedule, for example, every hour. You can slowly extend the time between bathroom trips.
220	There is a wide age range when puberty starts. That is why some kids in 7th grade still look like young children and others look really grown up. Problems with puberty usually involve hormones. There are many different hormone problems that result in too few hormones so that: Puberty is delayed or doesn't start at all Less often, there are too many hormones and the girl has: Early puberty You may wonder when you will get your period. Usually girls get their period about 2 years after their breasts start to grow. Menstrual Periods : Each month, one of your ovaries releases an egg. The egg goes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. Each month, the uterus creates a lining of blood and tissue. You might feel: - Irritable - Have trouble sleeping - Sad - Less confident about yourself. When to Call the Doctor : Talk to your health care provider if you have: - Worries about puberty - Really long, heavy periods - Irregular periods that do not seem to get regular - Lots of pain and cramping with your periods - Any itching or odor from your private parts. This could be a sign of a yeast infection or a sexually transmitted disease.
226	Stroke is the number one cause of serious adult disability in the United States. With time and patience, a stroke survivor should be able to regain some, and sometimes all, language and speaking abilities. People cannot articulate words normally because part of the nervous system that controls muscles used in speech is damaged. If the cause is a stroke, a head injury, or brain surgery, the goal is to restore and preserve speech. If dysarthria is mild, repetition of words or sentences may enable people to relearn to use facial muscles and the tongue for correct pronunciation. People are taught exercises that increase control of the mouth, tongue, and lips and are taught to speak more slowly and use shorter phrases. Poor control of breathing muscles may force people to take a breath in the middle of a sentence. Doing breathing exercises can also help, sometimes by breathing through handheld assistive devices, which help dislodge mucus in the airways. You may need to be referred to a speech and language therapist for testing and treatment. Learn more about stroke signs, treatment, and prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Special skills you may learn include: Safe chewing or swallowing techniques, if needed To avoid conversations when you are tired To repeat sounds over and over again so you can learn mouth movements To speak slowly, use a louder voice, and pause to make sure other people understand What to do when you feel frustrated while speaking You can use many different devices or techniques to help with speech, such as: Apps that use photos or speech Computers or cell phones to type out words Flip cards with words or symbols Surgery may help people with dysarthria. Things that family and friends can do to communicate better with someone who has dysarthria include: Turn off the radio or TV. Depending on the cause of dysarthria, symptoms may improve, stay the same, or get worse slowly or quickly. The aim of physical therapy is to have the stroke patient relearn simple motor activities such as walking, sitting, standing, lying down, and the process of switching from one type of movement to another. Some people with Parkinson disease or multiple sclerosis lose the ability to speak. Dysarthria caused by medicines or poorly fitting dentures can be reversed. Dysarthria caused by a stroke or brain injury will not get worse, and may improve. Dysarthria after surgery to the tongue or voice box should not get worse, and may improve with therapy. Their speech is poorly pronounced (such as slurring), and the rhythm or speed of their speech changes. Other symptoms include: Sounding as though they are mumbling Speaking softly or in a whisper Speaking in a nasal or stuffy, hoarse, strained, or breathy voice A person with dysarthria may also drool and have problems chewing or swallowing. Another type of therapy to help patients relearn daily activities is occupational therapy. Its goal is to help the stroke patient relearn everyday activities such as eating, drinking and swallowing, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and using the toilet. Occupational therapists seek to help the patient become independent or semi-independent. Speech therapy helps stroke patients relearn language and speaking skills, or learn other forms of communication. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who have no problems with cognition or thinking, but have problems understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech.
227	Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. Live shingles vaccine can provide protection against shingles and PHN.Another type of shingles vaccine, recombinant shingles vaccine, is the preferred vaccine for the prevention of shingles. However, live shingles vaccine may be used in some circumstances (for example if a person is allergic to recombinant shingles vaccine or prefers live shingles vaccine, or if recombinant shingles vaccine is not available).Adults 60 years and older who get live shingles vaccine should receive 1 dose, administered by injection. Shingles vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. The shingles vaccine is a safe and easy, one-time shot that may keep you from getting shingles. Most people age 60 and older should get vaccinated. You should get the shot even if you have already had shingles or don't remember having chickenpox. However, if you have a weak immune system or allergies to certain medicines, make sure to check with your doctor first. You can get the shingles vaccine at your doctor's office and at some pharmacies. All Medicare Part D plans and most private health insurance plans will cover the cost. Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash of fluid-filled blisters. A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. If the chickenpox virus becomes active, it travels to your skin where it causes painful sores Doctors dont know what causes the virus to become active again, but it sometimes happens when medicines or other illnesses weaken your immune system Adults ages 50 and older and people with a weakened immune system are more likely to get shingles You usually get shingles only once Medicines cant cure shingles, but antivirals (medicines that stop viruses) and pain medicine may help you feel better A vaccine can prevent shingles Go to a doctor right away if you think you have shingles, because treatment works best when started early. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait. A person should not get shingles vaccine who: - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. - Has a weakened immune system because of current: - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system, - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids, - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy, - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine. Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems.
228	It can also be caused by a head or neck injury. Occipital neuralgia can either be primary or secondary. Occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head. Typically, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards. Some individuals will also experience pain in the scalp, forehead, and behind the eyes. Their scalp may also be tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light. The location of pain is related to the areas supplied by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, which run from the area where the spinal column meets the neck, up to the scalp at the back of the head. The pain is caused by irritation or injury to the nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves by overly tight neck muscles, compression of the nerve as it leaves the spine due to osteoarthritis, or tumors or other types of lesions in the neck. Localized inflammation or infection, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position are also associated with occipital neuralgia. In many cases, however, no cause can be found. A positive response (relief from pain) after an anesthetic nerve block will confirm the diagnosis. A secondary condition is associated with an underlying disease. Osteoarthritis of the upper cervical spine Trauma to the greater and/or lesser occipital nerves Compression of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerves or C2 and/or C3 nerve roots from degenerative cervical spine changes Cervical disc disease Tumors affecting the C2 and C3 nerve roots Gout Diabetes Blood vessel inflammation Infection Symptoms Symptoms of occipital neuralgia include continuous aching, burning and throbbing, with intermittent shocking or shooting pain that generally starts at the base of the head and goes to the scalp on one or both sides of the head. Patients often have pain behind the eye of the affected side of the head. Causes Occipital neuralgia can be the result of pinched nerves or muscle tightness in the neck. Additionally, a movement as light as brushing hair may trigger pain. It can also be caused by a head or neck injury. Occipital neuralgia can either be primary or secondary. A secondary condition is associated with an underlying disease.
230	Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Talk to your doctor about the risk of taking this medication. Ropinirole may cause other side effects. Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: More common Confusion dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position drowsiness falling nausea seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there (hallucinations) sleepiness or unusual drowsiness swelling of the legs twisting, twitching, or other unusual body movements unusual tiredness or weakness worsening of parkinsonism Less common Abdominal or stomach pain bloating or swelling of the face, arms, hands, lower legs, or feet blood in the urine blurred vision burning, pain, or difficulty in urinating chest pain chills cold sweats cough double vision or other eye or vision problems fainting fear or nervousness feeling of constant movement of self or surroundings high or low blood pressure irregular or pounding heartbeat loss of memory mental depression pain pain in the arms or legs pounding in the ears rapid weight gain sensation of spinning slow or fast heartbeat sore throat sweating tightness in chest tingling of the hands or feet tingling, numbness, or prickly feelings trouble in concentrating troubled breathing unusual weight gain or loss vomiting Rare Anxiety buzzing or ringing in the ears changes in vision fever headache joint pain loss of bladder control muscle cramps, pain, or spasms nasal congestion runny nose sneezing trouble with swallowing unusual urges Ropinirole may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: - nausea - vomiting - stomach pain - heartburn or gas - diarrhea - constipation - decrease in appetite - weight loss - dizziness - drowsiness - tiredness - weakness - headache - sweating or flushing - confusion - difficulty remembering or concentrating - anxiety - uncontrolled, sudden body movements - shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control - decreased sensitivity (response) to touch - frequent or urgent need to urinate - difficulty urinating or pain when urinating - in men, difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection - back, muscle, or joint pain - pain, burning, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet - swelling of the hands, arms, feet, ankles, or lower legs - dry mouth Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: - hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist) - fainting - chest pain - slow, fast, or irregular heartbeat - shortness of breath - difficulty swallowing - double vision or other changes in vision People who have Parkinson's disease may have a greater risk of developing melanoma (a type of skin cancer) than people who do not have Parkinson's disease. There is not enough information to tell whether medications used to treat Parkinson's disease such as ropinirole increase the risk of developing skin cancer. You should have regular skin examinations to check for melanoma while you are taking ropinirole even if you do not have Parkinson's disease. Talk to your doctor about the risk of taking ropinirole. Some people taking ropinirole and other similar medications have developed fibrotic changes (scarring or thickening) in their lungs and heart valves. It is not yet known whether this problem is caused by ropinirole.
231	Unfortunately, there is no cure for Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS). After initial improvement, 3 to 10% of people with Guillain-Barr syndrome develop chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Most people who have Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) regain muscle strength within a few months after diagnosis and treatment. Some people may have a slower recovery from the symptoms of GBS, and they may be in the hospital or on a ventilator for a longer time. About 30% of people who had GBS continue to have muscle weakness years after the first symptoms of GBS.[3][8][9] In rare cases, people have passed away from complications of GBS. Causes of death may include acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, pulmonary emboli, and unexplained cardiac arrest.[8] Some people with GBS may relapse after an original improvement of symptoms.[10] The risk of relapse appears to be higher in people who have had a later onset of treatment, a longer-lasting disease, and other medical problems occurring at the same time.[3] For many with GBS, suddenly relying on family members and medical professionals to help with tasks required for daily living can be devastating. In some cases, people with GBS may suffer from anxiety or depression.[3] It is important for people with GBS and their family members to tell their doctor about signs and symptoms of depression, especially if the depression is long-lasting and does not improve as the physical symptoms of GBS improve. Both of these therapies can help prevent the immune system from continuing to attack the peripheral nervous system.[1][3] In some cases, corticosteroids have been used to try to alleviate symptoms of GBS. Because of sensory nerve damage, affected individuals can lose the ability to sense the position of their limbs and can have abnormal or absent reflexes (areflexia).Miller Fisher syndrome, another type of Guillain-Barr syndrome, involves cranial nerves, which extend from the brain to various areas of the head and neck. Miller Fisher syndrome is characterized by three features: weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eyes (ophthalmoplegia), problems with balance and coordination (ataxia), and areflexia. People with this condition can have other signs and symptoms common in Guillain-Barr syndrome, such as muscle weakness. Guillain-Barr syndrome occurs in people of all ages. Prior to developing the condition, most people with Guillain-Barr syndrome have a bacterial or viral infection. During the second phase, called the plateau, signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barr syndrome stabilize. However, it has not been proven that steroids can help speed recovery.[3] People who have GBS may be admitted to the hospital for treatment and to reduce the risk of complications. Summary Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your peripheral nervous system (PNS). Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. In some cases, other treatments may be necessary to prevent complications of GBS including pain medications and heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots. Some people with GBS may require help breathing with a ventilator.[3] Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended to help people fully recover from GBS.[3] Damage stops progressing within 8 weeks. Without treatment, most people with Guillain-Barr syndrome improve slowly over several months. About 30% of adults and even more children with the disorder have residual weakness 3 years after the syndrome began.
232	Causes include: Problems with your bladder muscles Something blocking your bladders opening, such as a kidney stone or enlarged prostate gland Severe constipation (fecal impaction) Nerve problems to your bladder (these can happen in people with health problems such as diabetes or Parkinson disease) To treat the cause of your urinary retention, doctors may: Have you stop any medicines that may be causing the problem If youre a man with an enlarged prostate, treat it with surgery or medicines Prescribe medicine to relax the muscles at the opening of your bladder If you have nerve problems, have you put a catheter in your bladder several times a day to drain urine Sometimes, do surgery to pass urine out of your body in a different way Urinary retention is when: You can't urinate (pee) at all or only a little You can urinate but there's still urine in your bladder after you're done With urinary retention: You may also leak urine and urinate without meaning to (urinary incontinence) Doctors will do an ultrasound after you pee to see how much urine is left in your bladder Doctors may use a catheter (thin flexible tube) to empty your bladder Certain medicines Urinary retention is more common in men because growth of the prostate can block the flow of urine. Catheterization Treatment of the cause Surgery, occasionally If people cannot urinate at all, doctors immediately insert a thin rubber tube into the bladder (urinary catheter) to remove the retained urine and provide relief. The cause of urinary retention is treated. Drugs that can cause urinary retention are stopped whenever possible. Men who have an enlarged prostate may need prostate surgery or drugs to shrink the prostate (for example, finasteride or dutasteride) or drugs that relax the muscles at the neck of the bladder (for example, terazosin or tamsulosin). People who have nerve problems that interfere with bladder contractions or function may need to use a catheter themselves periodically or have a catheter permanently placed. Occasionally surgery is needed to direct urine from the bladder away from the urethra and out of the body. If you cant urinate at all, doctors will insert a catheter into your bladder right away to drain the urine.
234	For this procedure, tiny electrodes are placed in the area of the brain involved in tremorsthe basal ganglia (collections of nerve cells that help smooth out muscle movements). The electrodes send small amounts of electricity to the specific area of the basal ganglia responsible for the tremors and thus help relieve symptoms. The location of the tremor How often you have the tremor and how strong it is Will do a neurological exam, including checking for Problems with balance Problems with speech Increased muscle stiffness May do blood or urine tests to look for the cause May do imaging tests to help figure out if the cause is damage in your brain May do tests which check your abilities to do daily tasks such as handwriting and holding a fork or cup May do an electromyogram. This is a test which measures involuntary muscle activity and how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation What are the treatments for tremor? If your tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away. Physical, speech-language, and occupational therapy, which may help to control tremor and deal with the daily challenges caused by the tremor If you find that caffeine and other stimulants trigger your tremors, it may be helpful to cut them from your diet. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Eliminating or minimizing the trigger may lessen the tremor. For example, avoiding caffeine, getting enough sleep, and minimizing stress may help. If many daily activities (such as using utensils and drinking from a glass at mealtime) become difficult or if the person's work requires steady hands, drug therapy may help. People with a physiologic tremor and anxiety may benefit from taking a low dose of a benzodiazepine (a sedative), such as lorazepam. Deep brain stimulation is sometimes done when drugs cannot control a severe, disabling tremor. If a physiologic tremor is worsened by taking prescribed drugs that are necessary or by feeling very anxious, propranolol (a beta-blocker) may help. Treatment usually involves medications used to control seizures (anticonvulsants) such as clonazepam or gabapentin. In some cases, treatment may include medications used for Parkinsons disease (levodopa or pramipexole), and/or botulinum toxin (Botox) injections in the leg muscles. More than one therapy may be tried before finding one that helps.[3] POT does not appear to alter life expectancy. However, quality of life for people with POT may be severely impaired due to physical symptoms, fear of falling, and uncertainty about the course of the disorder.[1] Doctors will treat the cause of your tremor. If you take medicines that could be causing your tremor, your doctors may be able to adjust your dose. If your tremor is mild, you may not need treatment. If your tremor happens when you reach for things, you may: Work with a therapist to use weights on your wrists to steady the tremor Hold your arm steady while reaching If your tremor happens when you walk, strapping a weight to your ankle may help steady your leg. Sometimes essential tremors or tremors due to Parkinson disease or another disorder require such treatment. Such treatments are used only when drug therapy has been tried and has been not been effective. These treatments are available only at special centers. For certain types, having a family history raises your risk of getting it. Symptoms of tremor may include Rhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or torso Shaky voice Difficulty writing or drawing Problems holding and controlling utensils, such as a spoon How is tremor diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider Will take your medical history Will do a physical exam, which includes checking Whether the tremor happens when the muscles are at rest or in action
235	All men should have their blood cholesterol levels tested every 5 years, starting at age 35 years. Some people's body makes too much cholesterol, no matter what they eat. This kind of high cholesterol problem runs in families. Eating a lot of foods high in fat and cholesterol Having diabetes Not being active Drinking too much alcohol Taking certain medicines You don't have to be fat to have high cholesterol. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. Your health care provider may prescribe medicine if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher What are the different types of medicines for cholesterol? There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol Bile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides. Nicotinic acid (niacin), which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL (good) cholesterol. Many adults should have their blood cholesterol levels tested at a younger age, possibly as early as age 20 years, if they have risk factors for heart disease. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your health care provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your health care provider will consider Your cholesterol levels Your risk for heart disease and stroke Your age Any other health problems you have Possible side effects of the medicines. Higher doses are more likely to cause side effects, especially over time. You need to keep taking your medicines and get regular cholesterol checks to make sure that you cholesterol levels are in a healthy range. Summary : Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body. You also may need to take medicine to lower your cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol in the blood can increase your risk of heart disease. Children with risk factors for heart disease should also have their blood cholesterol levels checked. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high blood cholesterol, but it can be detected with a blood test. You are likely to have high cholesterol if members of your family have it, if you are overweight or if you eat a lot of fatty foods. You can lower your cholesterol by exercising more and eating more fruits and vegetables. Some expert groups recommend cholesterol testing for all children ages 9 to 11 and again between ages 17 and 21. Have your cholesterol checked more often (probably every year) if you have: Diabetes Heart disease Blood flow problems to your feet or legs A history of stroke A blood cholesterol test measures the level of total cholesterol. This includes HDL (good) cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol. Your LDL level is what health care providers watch most closely.
238	Doctors can usually determine whether the cause is age-related changes, mild cognitive impairment, or early dementia based on the type of memory loss and the symptoms that accompany it. Subdural hematomas (pockets of blood under the outer layer of the membranes covering the brain) Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) They include those that interfere with the supply of blood or nutrients to the brain, such as a cardiac arrest and certain types of stroke. They also include unusually long seizures, head injuries, a brain infection, HIV infection, brain tumors, and overuse of certain drugs (including alcohol). Memory loss that is more serious may be a warning sign of a brain function problem, such as Alzheimer disease or dementia. Ability to understand spatial relationships: Copy simple and complex structures (for example, using building blocks) and draw an object such as clock, cube, or house. This testing also assesses abstract thinking, comprehension, the ability to follow commands and solve math problems, awareness of the illness, and mood. TableSome Causes and Features of Memory Loss Cause Common Features* Tests Age-related memory changes (age-associated memory impairment) Occasional forgetfulness of such things as names or the location of car keys No effect on thinking, other mental functions, or the ability to do daily activities A doctor's examination (particularly a neurologic examination and mental status testing to assess functions such as attention, orientation, and memory) Mild cognitive impairment Memory loss that is more severe than expected for a person's age, particularly difficulty remembering recent events and conversations (short-term memory loss) No effect on the ability to do daily activities An increased risk of developing dementia A doctor's examination Sometimes formal neuropsychologic testing, which resembles mental status testing but evaluates function in more detail Dementia Memory loss that becomes worse as time passes, eventually with no awareness of the loss Difficulty using and understanding language, doing usual manual tasks, thinking, and planning (for example, planning and shopping for meals), resulting in not being able to function normally Disorientation (for example, not knowing the time or location) Difficulty recognizing faces or common objects Changes in personality or behavior (for example, becoming irritable, agitated, paranoid, inflexible, or disruptive) A doctors examination Usually MRI or CT of the brain Sometimes formal neuropsychologic testing Possibly a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to measure levels of two abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) that occur in Alzheimer disease Sometimes blood tests to check for certain causes, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) or a vitamin deficiency Depression Memory loss and awareness of the loss, usually accompanied by intense sadness, and lack of interest in usual pleasures Sometimes sleep problems (too little or too much), loss of appetite, and slowing of thinking, speech, and general activity Common among people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or age-related changes in memory A doctors examination Sometimes use of standardized questionnaires to identify depression Drugs, such as Drugs with anticholinergic effects, including some antidepressants and many antihistamines (used in OTC sleep aids, cold remedies, and allergy drugs) CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; OTC = over-the-counter. Usually, memory loss results from normal age-related changes in the brain, which slow mental functions slightly but do not significantly impair them. Having a healthy lifestyle, staying mentally active, and participating in social activities may help maintain mental function or postpone its decline. Using lists and other memory aids, focusing on one thing at a time, and getting organized can help older people compensate for age-related changes in memory. The most common causes of memory loss are Age-related changes in memory (most common) Mild cognitive impairment Dementia Depression Age-related changes in memory (called age-associated memory impairment) refer to the normal slight decline in brain function that occurs as people age. Retrieving memories of new things, such as what is a new neighbor's name or how to use a new computer program, takes longer. Depression can cause a type of memory loss (called pseudodementia) that resembles memory loss due to dementia. However, people with memory loss due to depression, unlike those with dementia, are aware of their memory loss and complain about it. Also, they rarely forget important current events or personal matters and usually have other symptoms, such as intense sadness, sleeping problems (too little or too much), sluggishness, or loss of appetite. Stress can interfere with forming a memory and with recalling a memory, partly by preoccupying people and thus preventing them from paying attention to other things. The most common cause of memory loss is: Getting olderminor changes in memory can be normal as you age Other common causes: Mild thinking problems (mild cognitive impairment)about half of the people who have this will get dementia a few years later Dementia (such as Alzheimer disease) Depressionif you have depression, you probably also have other symptoms, such as intense sadness and problems sleeping Some medicines Overusing drugs or alcohol Doctors may also do blood tests to measure levels of vitamin B12 and thyroid hormones to determine whether vitamin B12 deficiency or a thyroid disorder could be causing memory loss. If a brain infection is suspected, doctors usually do a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to obtain samples of the fluid around the brain (cerebrospinal fluid) for analysis.
239	This condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 newborn girls worldwide, but it is much more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths). Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition in which a female does not have the usual pair of two X chromosomes. Turner syndrome affects about 1 of every 2,500 female live births worldwide. This disorder affects all races and regions of the world equally. There are no known environmental risks for Turner syndrome. Parents who have had many unaffected children can still have a child with Turner syndrome later on. Generally, Turner syndrome is not passed on from mother to child. In most cases, women with Turner syndrome are infertile.
