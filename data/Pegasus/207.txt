Children may also have epilepsy, a broad or beaked nose, scalp defects, drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and gaps or fissures (colobomas) of the iris, cleft palate, and delayed bone development. The major features of this disorder include a characteristic facial appearance, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, and seizures. Other characteristic facial features include a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum), a downturned mouth, a small chin (micrognathia), and poorly formed ears with small holes (pits) or flaps of skin (tags). Many people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome survive infections, and ultimately may reduce the risk of having chest infections and seizures in the absence of severe heart defects. Muscle weakness may increase the risk for heart attacks and strokes.[5][6][7][8] People with WHS are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than people without WHS.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][36][37][38][
