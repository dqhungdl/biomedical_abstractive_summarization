Affected individuals have a high level of an antibody called immunoglobulin M (IgM) in their blood, which can cause thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity).[2] Although some individuals initially do not have symptoms and are diagnosed from routine blood work, common symptoms may include weakness, appetite loss and weight loss. These abnormal cells produce excess amounts of IgM, a type of protein known as an immunoglobulin; the overproduction of this large protein is how the condition got its name ("macroglobulinemia").Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia usually begins in a person's sixties and is a slow-growing (indolent) cancer. Some affected individuals have elevated levels of IgG and lymphoplasmacytic cells but no symptoms of the condition; in these cases, the disease is usually found incidentally by a blood test taken for another reason.Treatment is often reserved for those with symptomatic Waldenstrm syndrome, and corticosteroids, alkylating agents (such as prednisone, and purine) are used to treat the condition.[2] Several other medications are available to treat this condition, including corticosteroids, interferon, and beta-blockers.[3] In some cases, these medications may be used alone or in combination with other medications.[4] In addition,
