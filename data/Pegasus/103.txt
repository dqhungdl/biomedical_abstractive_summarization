Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. Vision loss usually happens slowly, so you may not notice it right away Glaucoma gets worse over time It can cause lasting vision loss and blindness if not treated Special eye drops (prescribed by your doctor) can lower the pressure in your eye Get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years to detect glaucoma early and help prevent vision loss If you have glaucoma, the doctor will need to check the pressure at your eyes often Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optics nerve and other parts of the eye, result in loss of vision, and lead to vision loss, blindness, and even death from a heart attack, stroke, or other heart attack-related condition, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or heart failure with arrhythmias (heart attacks, strokes, or sudden cardiac death) Glaucoma can strike anyone, but the risk is much greater for people over 60.
