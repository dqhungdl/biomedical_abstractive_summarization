About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barr have residual weakness after 3 years. About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack. Possible complications of GBS include: Breathing difficulty (respiratory failure) Shortening of tissues in the joints (contractures) or other deformities Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) that form when the person with GBS is inactive or has to stay in bed Increased risk of infections Low or unstable blood pressure Paralysis that is permanent Pneumonia Skin damage (ulcers) Breathing food or fluids into the lungs About 15 percent of individuals experience long-term weakness; some may require ongoing use of a walker, wheelchair, or ankle support. With careful intensive care and successful treatment of infection, autonomic dysfunction and other medical complications, even those individuals with respiratory failure usually survive. Typically, the point of greatest weakness occurs days to at most 4 weeks after the first symptoms occur. Symptoms then stabilize at this level for a period of days, weeks, or, sometimes months.
