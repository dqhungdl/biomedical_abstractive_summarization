In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent. Acrocallosal syndrome (or severe Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry two copies of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. When an individual receives one normal gene and one abnormal gene, the person will be a carrier for the disease, but usually will not show symptoms. When a person receives two normal genes and two abnormal genes, he or she will inherit the same condition.
