Viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen)*** and quarantine after discontinuation of isolation or precautions For adults previously diagnosed with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic after recovery, retesting or quarantine is not recommended if another exposure occurs or might have occurred within 90 days after the date of symptom onset from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some adults with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset; severely immunocompromised patients** may produce virus beyond 20 days and require additional testing and consultation with infectious diseases specialists and infection control experts. In the case of severe illness, some adults may be able to produce a virus that can be transmitted from person to person for at least 20 days without the use of fever-reducing medications, without the need for additional testing, and with the improvement of other symptoms, including fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as other symptoms that may be associated with COVID 19 infection, such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore eyes, sore throats, and other symptoms associated with the virus, including diarrhea
