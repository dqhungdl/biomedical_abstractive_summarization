In general, survival rates decrease with age and are lowest for elderly patients.[2] Unfortunately, specific statistics regarding the prognosis for adults with BL appear to be more scarce.[8] The outlook is poor for both children and adults if BL returns after improvement (relapses) or does not go into remission as a result of the first cycle of chemotherapy.[9][2] Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL). The cancerous B-cells are within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone.[1] Although MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed. The need for treatment is usually determined by symptoms, how fast the disease is progressing, and if blood counts are low.[1][3] MCL accounts for 6% of all NHL's and is mostly found in males during their early 60s.[4][2][3] More than one half of people with BL can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. Differential diagnosis, in addition to histological analysis of the adenopathy, confirms the diagnosis of diffuse B cell lymphoma.[18] The observation of the translocation t(14;18) by polymerase chain reaction
