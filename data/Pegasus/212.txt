It is caused by changes (such mutations ) in any one of five different genes and is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner.[][4] The lungs typically have at least one serious fungal infection, although some individuals do not show symptoms until later in life.[3] Treatment consists of continuous therapy with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs to suppress the immune system and prevent infection.[5] The most common type of treatment is a bone marrow transplant.[6][7] Bone marrow transplantation is the most common form of treatment for this condition.[8][9] Bone marrow transplant is the only type of transplant that can be performed in the United States.[9][0] Bone marrow transplants are also available in Europe and Asia.[10][11] In some cases, bone marrow transplants may not be possible because the patient's immune system is compromised.[12][13] In other cases, the patient may be unable to receive bone marrow transplantation.[14][15]
