The company making the dietary supplement should be able to send you information on the safety and/or effectiveness of the ingredients in a product, which you can then discuss with your doctor. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) checks prescription medicines, such as antibiotics or blood pressure medicines, to make sure they are safe and do what they promise. To get such a seal, products must be made by following good manufacturing procedures, must contain what is listed on the label, and must not have harmful levels of ingredients that don't belong there, like lead. The Federal Government does not regularly test what is in dietary supplements, and companies are not required to share information about the safety of a dietary supplement with the FDA before they sell it. The companies are responsible for making sure the supplement is safe, but the FDA does not evaluate whether the product is safe and does what the label says it contains. For some supplements, the only evidence suggesting effectiveness is reports about individual people or studies conducted in animals. Eating a variety of healthy foods is the best way to get the nutrients you need for a healthy diet, and some people may not get enough of the nutrients they need from a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and fish.
