Research suggests that other factors such as smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones due to night shift working also may increase breast cancer risk. Older women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting breast cancer than those at a normal weight. Being around certain things can raise your chances of cancer, including: Tobacco smoke: Lung, mouth, throat, esophagus, kidney, and bladder cancers (a mineral fiber used for insulation and other building materials): Lung cancer and mesothelioma (cancer in the tissues that line your lungs) Sunlight: Skin cancer X-rays: Leukemia and cancer in the organ exposed to radiation Radon (a radioactive gas that comes from the ground and can build up to harmful levels in basements): Lung Cancer Some chemicals used at work (such as benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride) can cause cancerous. Another reason is that people in different areas may have different genetic risk factors. A gene can go bad if: The gene was damaged by something you were exposed to (an environmental factor) The gene wasn't copied incorrectly during normal cell growth Less likely, you inherited a cancer gene from one of your parents. One cancer-causing gene called BRCA increases the risk of breast cancer.
