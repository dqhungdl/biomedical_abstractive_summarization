Insulin, a hormone made in your pancreas, helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels. Because of these changes, your body's cells don't use insulin well, a condition called insulin resistance. Women who are overweight or obese may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also increase your risk of gestational diabetes, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAMA Obstetrical and Gynecological Obstetrics and Gynecology). Women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to have a family history of diabetes than women who do not have diabetes, the study found. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed in the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. Diabetes means your blood sugar, also called blood sugar levels, is too high. Diabetes mellitus is a type of diabetes that occurs when your body can't produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot.
