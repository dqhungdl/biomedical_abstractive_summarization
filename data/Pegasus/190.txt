To learn about clinical trials that include genetic testing for Usher syndrome, visit the Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov and type in the search term Usher syndrome or three Usher genetictesting. The term autosomal recessive means that the mutated gene is not located on either of the chromosomes that determine the type of a persons sex; in other words, both males and females can have the disorder and can pass it on to their children. If you have a child with Usher syndrome type I or type II, you should contact your childs doctor as soon as possible if you suspect that your child may have Usher syndrome. If your child has type II or type III, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who specializes in Usher syndrome and may be able to help you determine if your child is a carrier of a mutation in the Usher syndrome gene.
