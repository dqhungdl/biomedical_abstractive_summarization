Gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) insertion is done in part using a procedure called endoscopy. After the endoscopy tube is inserted, the skin over the left side of belly (abdomen) area is cleaned and numbed. The doctor uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube. Care for your stitches and wound as follows: Keep the area clean and dry for the first 24 to 48 hours after stitches have been placed. This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end of it. Your provider should also tell you when you need to have a wound checked and the stitches removed. Then, you can start to gently wash around the site 1 to 2 times daily. If there was a bandage over the stitches, replace it with a new clean bandage and antibiotic treatment, if instructed to do so. Avoid using the towel directly on the stitches. Dab the site dry with a clean paper towel. The G-tube is inserted through this cut into the stomach. A gastrostomy eating tube insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall.
