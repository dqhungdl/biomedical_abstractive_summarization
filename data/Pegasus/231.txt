With early treatment, people can improve very quicklyin days or weeks. Most people who have Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) regain muscle strength within a few months after diagnosis and treatment. About 30% of people who had GBS continue to have muscle weakness years after the first symptoms of GBS. However, symptoms of the syndrome can be improved with treatments including plasma exchange therapy and immunoglobulin therapy. Some people with GBS may relapse after an original improvement of symptoms. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended to help people fully recover from GBS, depending on the severity of the disease and the length of time it has taken for symptoms to improve. Some of these therapies can help prevent the immune system from continuing to attack the peripheral nervous system. The risk of relapse appears to be higher in patients who have had a later onset of treatment, a longer-lasting disease, and other medical problems occurring at the same time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), but there are treatments available to help prevent relapse.
