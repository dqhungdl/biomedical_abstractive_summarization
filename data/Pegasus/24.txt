If no identifiable mutation or deletion in SLC20A2 is found, sequence analysis of PDGFRB and PDGFB may be considered.[1] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. Off label prescription of biphosphanates have been reported in few patients The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon:[1] 1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging, 2) presence of progressive neurological dysfunction, 3) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (a person must inherit one copy of the altered gene from one parent to have the condition). In about half of individuals with primary familial brain calcification the genetic cause is unknown. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominance inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered,[1] Genetic testing may help to confirm the diagnosis. For individuals in who a diagnosis ofPFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. Genetic testing for PFBC is not recommended for simplex patients.[2] Genetic testing is recommended for patients with PFBC
