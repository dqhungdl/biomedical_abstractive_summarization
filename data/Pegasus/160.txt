People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another to cause diabetes.16Weight loss can help control type 2 diabetes so that you are healthier. For people who inherit a gene variant higher than for those who do not carry the variant, diet and physical activity lead to a major clinical trial involving people with diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Institute.1 However, even in those with a genetic predisposition to diabetes, the risk of developing diabetes is about 80 percent higher than in the general population.17Weight loss has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk for diabetes, but it is not the only way to control your blood sugar levels.18
