Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. Other common causes of elbow pain are: Bursitis -- inflammation of a fluid-filled cushion beneath the skin Arthritis -- narrowing of the joint space and loss of cartilage in the elbow Elbow strains Infection of the elbow Tendon tears -- biceps rupture This is inflammation and injury to the tendons, which are soft tissues that attach muscle to bone. Treatment depends on the cause, but may involve: Antibiotics Corticosteroid shots Manipulation Pain medicine Physical therapy Surgery (last resort) Does the pain shift from the elbow to other joints? Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. If this hurts or you cannot move the elbow, take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain. If you have a history of heart disease or kidney disease, you may be able to use these medicines to treat your elbow pain.
