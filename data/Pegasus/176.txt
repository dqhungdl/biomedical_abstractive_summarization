Researchers are working to develop new treatment options for the future such as gene therapy, stem cell transplantation and prosthetic implants.[2][3] Vitamin A palmitate Omega-3 fatty acid supplements Lutein plus zeaxanthin supplements Sometimes, drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Sometimes, surgically implanted computer chips No treatment can reverse the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptors and other celltypes Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. Though treatment of these technologies has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products listed below, preliminary research has been explored to determine whether retinal transplantation would be a relatively safe and effective treatment option.[2] Current research is focused on the integration of a retinal prosthesis into the retina, in hopes of more research is needed to determine a structural role in retinal transplantation, and the effects of vitamin A supplements on the retina should be considered.[4] Current research should involve the development of retinal prosthetics, which could restore some vision to people with a particular mutation, provided they still have some retinal cells capable of surviving and reproducing.
