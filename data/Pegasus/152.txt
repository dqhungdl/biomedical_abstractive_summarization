In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5, which results in the intellectual disability and health problems characteristic of this disorder. An infant with this syndrome may have a low birth weight and a small head with many abnormal features, including a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Many cases of cri du chat syndrome survive to adulthood but have substantial disabilities. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosomal 5.Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A few cases are caused by the deletion of a single piece of chromosome, but most cases are due to a rearrangement of a different form of chromosome that occurs during the early stages of fetal development, such as when a mother passes a
