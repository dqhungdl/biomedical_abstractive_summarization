Therefore, the physician who elects to use Ritalin LA for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). SR Tablets: Ritalin-SR tablets have a duration of action of approximately 8 hours. The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours (1.3-8.2 hours)for the SR tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3-4.4 hours) for the tablets. In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received SR tablets, plasma concentrations of Ritalins major metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. Effects on QT The effect of Focalin XR (moxifloxacin) on the QT interval was neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the drugs effect on the central nervous system (see Effects on QT and Mental and Behavioral Effects in the Medication Guide for more information on the effects on QT on Ritalin , see Psychopharmacology for more specific information about the effect on QT in Ritalin XR, and?Psychopharmacology  for additional information about Ritalin in children.
