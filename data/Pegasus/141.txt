In addition to FLUAD Quadrivalent, one other flu vaccine is licensed specifically for people 65 years and older. The high-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent) contains four times the amount of antigen as the standard-dose inactivated flu vaccine, and has been associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination and better effectiveness than the regular dose flu vaccine in older people in a two-season randomized trial. In the United States, flu vaccines are licensed only for persons aged 65 years or older, and are not recommended for children under 6 years of age.
