Other areas of research involve trying to understand better how and why joint injuries occur and the measures that should be taken to prevent them, investigating the role of exercise in protecting the knee, and developing less invasive surgeries and better joint prostheses. Studies of the various forms of arthritis are helping doctors better understand these diseases and develop treatments to stop or slow their progression and damage to joints, including the knees. Studies involving imaging techniques, in combination with measurements of biochemical markers, could result in early identification of diseases affecting the knee. However, people can prevent many knee problems by doing the following: Before exercising or participating in sports, then do some knee stretches, such as walking or riding a stationary bicycle, or participate in sports that cause knee problems (such as participating in a bicycle accident) and better knee prostheses. Here are some common causes of knee pain: MEDICAL CONDITIONS Under the goal of kneecap swelling (MCL) injury, an unstable ligament may cause swelling (inflammation) from other causes, like a fluid-filled knee ligament or a synovial fluid (fluid-filled) kneecap injury, which may lead to osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Overusing your knee can trigger knee problems that may trigger an unstable collateral ligament injury (ACL) or osteoarthritis (RA
