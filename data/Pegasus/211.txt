If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. The shingles vaccine is a safe and easy, one-time shot that may keep you from getting shingles. There are two shingles vaccines: a newer recombinant vaccine and an older, weakened live-virus vaccine. The recombinant vaccine is preferred and is recommended for healthy people aged 50 or over, regardless of whether they recall having had chickenpox or shingles. Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. Shingles vaccine is given in two doses, injected into a muscle. The doses are given 2 to 6 months apart and at least 2 months after the older (weakened live) virus vaccine for people who have had that vaccine. When shingles occurs, taking antiviral drugs may reduce the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia. Shingles can also reduce pain in people whose immune systems are weakened because of cancer, or drugs such as chemotherapy or steroids such as neomycin, which are not recommended for shingles vaccine use. People may have a harder time fighting off infections as they get older. Shingles and neomycin: Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to penicillin, or any other component of shingles
