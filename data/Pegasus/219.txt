Your doctor may suggest you try the following: Pelvic muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises) work the muscles that you use to stop urinating. Timed voiding may help you control your bladder. Besides bladder control training, you may want to talk with your doctor about other ways to help manage incontinence:- Medicines can help the bladder empty more fully during urination. There are bladder control products and other solutions, including adult diapers, furniture pads, urine deodorizing pills, and special skin cleansers that may make leaking urine bother you a little less. - Some women find that using an estrogen vaginal cream may help relieve stress or urge incontinence. A pessary, a stiff ring inserted into the vagina, may help prevent leaking if you have a prolapsed bladder or vagina. - Nerve stimulation, which sends mild electric current to the nerves around the bladder that help control urination, may be another option. Losing weight, quitting smoking, saying no to alcohol, drinking less caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and many sodas), preventing constipation and avoiding lifting heavy objects may help with incontinence. Biofeedback uses sensors to make you aware of signals from the muscles in your bladder and urethra. Learn more about pelvic floor exercises and how to do them
